#MISSIONS & DECISIONS #NT!
VEN_decision_category_the_caudillos_crisis: "The Caudillos Crisis"
VEN_decision_category_the_caudillos_crisis_desc: "The warlords of Venezuela, colloquially known as the caudillos, originated from the War of Independence and from Venezuela's separation of La Gran Colombia. In the chaos with everyone trying to seize power and deciding who would be the first leader of the nation, several of these caudillos emerged, taking various lands forcefully. \n\nBeing a massive headache to the Venezuelan government, given that they had turned into guerrillas, an agreement was reached. They would be given official and autonomous power over their controlled lands, so long as they'd work under the government, reassuring their authority with their own militias. From that point on, the caudillos are the actual people in power, removing governments if they don't like their decisions. This is because Venezuela has no actual army of its own, since this would have caused massive issues with them. The only thing separating the caudillos between power over the nation and death is their own combatants, mostly incapable and incompetent men who were given a weapon and no training. If the government manages to build an army, these would take out the combatants of the caudillos in no time, leading up to their downfall. As such, there has always been tension between the caudillos and the government, because even if each have their differences, there is a common enemy; the President of Venezuela.\n\nThere is, however, a problem. While attempts were and could be made to remove the government's main headache, the caudillos would act swiftly to end the efforts and remove those in power. Due to all of these things, if we want to stay in power, we need to make sure to remove the caudillos, very carefully, however, because otherwise, the nation will collapse.\n\n§RCurrent Unrest: §Y[?Root.VEN_caudillos_unrest]§!\n§CCurrent Influence: §Y[?Root.VEN_caudillos_influence]§!"
VEN_decision_prohibit_slavery: "Prohibit the Slave Keeping"
VEN_decision_prohibit_slavery_desc: "For too long have slaves been captives of the rich, trapped in the halls of their haciendas, doomed to live forever as unfairly paid servants. This is too inhumane, we can't just stand and turn a blind eye. On the other hand, this could potentially cause much unhappiness among the caudillos and the population."
VEN_decision_restrict_freedom: "Restrict Freedom"
VEN_decision_restrict_freedom_desc: "We need to take the next step to progress as a nation. However, change often causes unhappiness. If we don't start to restrict the freedom of the people now, this might have negative consequences in the future. We should start off with the caudillos."
VEN_decision_promote_national_reconciliation: "Promote National Reconciliation"
VEN_decision_promote_national_reconciliation_desc: "Our country has been plagued with resistance and revolution since its birth. Never has the people been satisfied with the current government, now even less, with tensions arising between the liberals and the conservatives. Spreading propaganda will not automatically fix this, but it might be a start."
VEN_decision_acquaintances_key_positions: "Put Acquaintances in Key Positions"
VEN_decision_acquaintances_key_positions_desc: "In order to ensure that our current government stays in power, trying to put the people we trust will greatly hold our position, and even more than that, caudillos will be more than satisfied, given the more powerful positions. Certainly looks like a win-win."
VEN_decision_allow_return_exiles: "Allow Return of Specific Exiles"
VEN_decision_allow_return_exiles_desc: "While bringing back those blacklisted from the nation could cause issues, it might calm things down. By bringing a very selective group of exiles who we, obviously, know that aren't troublemakers, we can calm the people while not causing problems for ourselves."
