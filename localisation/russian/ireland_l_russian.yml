Several armed groups have demanded that our government recognize their struggle and their political movement as a legitimate.\n\nWe are faced with a tough decision; some hot-headed Republicans believe this is enough motive to round up all the Unionists once and for all, while some are surprisingly in favour of giving them full recognition and even autonomy!\n\nWe can either give them everything they want, and benefit from their wealth, or destroy them, ravaging our country in war once again. Or maybe we can take the long route, and come to a common agreement between us all?\n" #NT!
