 eoanb_bulgaria.10.d: "Girdap's constituent assembly was held on 1 December 1881, less than four years after the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the Danube, its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with Central Europe along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, as most people employed the services of money lenders and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to \"liberate the population of money lenders\", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev. Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15-18% as compared to the over 20-30% interest rate of money lenders. The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the constituent assembly was held." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.16.d: "The intrigues surrounding the candidate for the Bulgarian throne began at the Berlin Congress itself. Subsequently, the Russian Emperor Alexander II imposed an additional condition, according to which no Russian subject could be elected as a Bulgarian prince. Among the first candidates were King Milan of Serbia and Prince Carol of Romania. The names of Prince Hermann Reuss-Köstritz, Prince Emmanuel Bogoridi, Prince Bibesko and some others were also put forward, but some of these were put forward to show that the Bulgarians were supposedly not unanimous in their preferences beforehand, while others were fictitious names that appeared in the press and were unlikely to be elected. Although his name was mentioned among the candidates, Prince Royce also did not accept to take part in the contest, since the newly adopted Bulgarian constitution required that the successor of the first Bulgarian prince should be of the Orthodox faith. At the last moment, England put forward Prince Waldemar of Denmark as a contender, but he was unknown in Bulgaria and there was no time to propagandize him accordingly. The Bulgarians liked two figures who had done a great service to the country: Count Nikolai Ignatiev and Prince Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov. But they were Russian subjects and could not participate in the race. After the Russian government officially declared this, the candidacy of Prince Alexander Battenberg began to gain real chances for the Bulgarian throne.As the time approached when the election of the Bulgarian prince was to take place, the name of Prince Alexander Battenberg became more and more popular. He was the nephew and favourite of the Russian Tsarina Maria Alexandrova and took a direct part in the Russo-Turkish War. Bulgarian voters no doubt took it as a consideration that, given his kinship with three of the ruling families of Europe, the election of Battenberg would face fewer obstacles from the great powers than any other candidate. Besides, she was not officially nominated by the Russian government, and the Bulgarians were told that they would not be pressed in their choice. It was not concealed, however, that it would give pleasure to the highest personages in Russia to have Prince Alexander Battenberg elected Prince of Bulgaria." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.17.t: "Battenberg's European Tour" #NT!
 eoanb_bulgaria.17.d: "From the interview of the politicians in Europe it appeared that the Bulgarian prince undertook his journey actuated by a sense of international propriety which prompted him to thank personally the rulers of the states which had approved his election. To the western capitals he set out to do just that. On the way back he intended to spend a few days with his family and then to go to Constantinople - to receive the berat, i.e. investiture, from the Sultan, and thence to proceed directly by sea to Bulgaria, landing at Varna.\n\nFrom Livadia Alexander Battenberg set out for Odessa, where he arrived on 18 May. He was met by the local governor-general, Adjutant-General Edward Totleben. Having inspected his 13th Battalion, he departed the same day for Vienna, where he arrived on 20 May. There the prince he spent several days. On 21 May he was received with great honour by Franz Joseph. The audience lasted a quarter of an hour, at which the Bulgarian monarch appeared in Russian general's uniform. He saw Count Andrassy several times and had long talks with him.\n\nPrince Alexander I remained in Vienna until the 23rd of May, when he went to Berlin by way of Dresden to present himself to the Emperor Wilhelm. According to the newspaper reports, talking to Bismarck, he expressed his concern about the fate that awaited him in Bulgaria, to which the Iron Chancellor allegedly objected: 'Never mind, go! In the German capital the prince formed his retinue, which included three Germans.\n\nFrom Berlin on May 30 he went to Paris, where he met the President of the French Republic. On 5 June he left for London and the summer residence of the royal family, Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. From England he went to Darmstadt, where he spent 10 days with his family and then travelled to Rome, where he arrived on 19 June. He also stayed there for a few days, receiving a most cordial reception from King Umberto. Alexander Battenberg was next to continue his journey to Constantinople, making the sea voyage on the Russian steamer Constantine already mentioned. Arrived in Constantinople on 5 July, Battenberg stayed there only a few hours." #NT!

The decision for the Chetnik Action was taken at the 1st Macedonian Congress in March 1895 in Sofia, which established the Macedonian Organization, headed by the Macedonian Committee. The action was organized and carried out with the knowledge of the government of Konstantin Stoilov and Prince Ferdinand I, as the Committee intended to exploit the deteriorated image of the Ottoman Empire in Europe after the Armenian massacres. The future of the rebels depends on us. Whether we help them or leave them to their fate." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.27.d: "The Tsar travelled both to and from the Manège in a closed two-seater carriage drawn by a pair of horses. He was accompanied by five mounted Cossacks and Frank (Franciszek) Joseph Jackowski, a Polish noble, with a sixth Cossack sitting on the coachman's left. The emperor's carriage was followed by three sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police Colonel Dvorzhitzky and two officers of the Gendarmerie. At 2:15 PM, the carriage had gone about 150 yards down the quay until it encountered Rysakov who was carrying a bomb wrapped in a handkerchief. On the signal being given by Perovskaya, Rysakov threw the bomb under the Tsar's carriage. The Cossack who rode behind was mortally wounded and died shortly that day. Among those injured was a fourteen year old peasant boy who served as a delivery boy in a butcher's shop. However, the explosion had only damaged the bulletproof carriage. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The coachman implored the Emperor not to alight. Dvorzhitzky offered to drive the Tsar back to the Palace in his sleigh. The Tsar agreed, but he decided to first see the culprit, and to survey the damage. He expressed solicitude for the victims. To the anxious inquires of his entourage, Alexander replied, "Thank God, I'm untouched". He was ready to drive away when a second bomber, Hryniewiecki, who had come close to the Tsar, made a sudden movement, throwing a bomb at his feet. A second explosion ripped through the air and the Emperor and his assassin fell to the ground, both mortally injured. Since people had crowded close to the Tsar, Hryniewiecki's bomb claimed more injuries than the first. Alexander was leaning on his right arm. His legs were shattered below the knee from which he was bleeding profusely, his abdomen was torn open, and his face was mutilated. Hryniewiecki himself, also gravely wounded from the blast, lay next to the Tsar and the butcher's boy. Ivan Yemelyanov, the third bomber in the crowd, stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed. However, he instead along with other bystanders rushed to answer the Tsar's barely audible cries for help; he could barely whisper "Take me to the palace... there... I will die." Alexander was carried by sleigh to his study in the Winter Palace, where almost the same day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. The dying emperor was given Communion and Last rites. When the attending physician, Sergey Botkin, was asked how long it would be, he replied, "Up to fifteen minutes." At 3:30 that day, the personal flag of Alexander II was lowered for the last time." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.28.t: "The 1881 Coup" #NT!
 eoanb_bulgaria.28.d: "Under the government of Karavelov, the rift between Prince Battenberg and the government in terms of domestic policy deepened. After a few months of rule, a number of necessary state institutions had still not been established, and inter-party squabbles made the National Assembly a laughing stock, widely reported in the press, with politicians' erratic behaviour reinforcing the belief abroad that they were incapable of governing. The judicial administration is corrupt, roads and bridges are crumbling. In the absence of an effective police force, larger and larger groups of people are forming around the country, ostensibly for self-defence but in practice for raids, often on Turkish villages, and the prince is forced to send the war minister, Hernroth, to restore order. The limited rights given to the prince by the constitution did not enable him to exert much influence. Earlier attempts to do something about it met with the firm resistance of Emperor Alexander II. After the assassination of the Russian Emperor on 1 March 1881, Battenberg went to his funeral, where he persuaded the new Russian Emperor Alexander III to support him. As a result, the Russian government began to consider the possibility of changing Bulgaria's form of government and possibly introducing an absolute monarchy, but eventually ruled in favour of suspending the Tarnovo Constitution, but by convening a Grand National Assembly. The prince also received consent for action in this direction from the Russian allies Germany and Austria-Hungary." #NT!

The leaders of the party were Petko Karavelov, Petko Slaveykov and Dragan Tsankov. On June 20, 1879, the newspaper "Tselokupna Bulgaria", a printed organ of the Liberal Party, began to be published. At the same time as the newspaper was published, the party's statutes were drawn up. In the second half of July to the beginning of September 1879, its central bureau was established. Local organisations of the party were also established. In 1883, the Liberal Party split after the moderate wing, led by Dragan Tsankov, agreed to a compromise and formed a coalition government with the Conservative Party. Dragan Cankov's wing later adopted extreme pro-Russian policies and renamed itself the Progressive Liberal Party." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.31.d: "On August 10, a group of officers in Plovdiv, led by the commander of the Plovdiv Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Sava Mutkurov, declared against the coup. They received the support of some liberals, such as Ivan Stoyanovich and Dimitar Tonchev, as well as the British consulate. Having established contact with the regiments in Pazardzhik, Haskovo and Stara Zagora, they began to concentrate in Plovdiv the units not accepting the coup and the provisional government. On 11 August, Stambolov issued a proclamation from Tarnovo declaring the coup illegal and appointing Mutkurov as commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian army. On his orders, Mutkurov sent an ultimatum to the coup leaders and the provisional government to resign their posts within 24 hours on pain of death. Before the deadline passed, Gruev and the chief of artillery, Major Olimpii Panov, contacted Stambolov in an attempt to prevent the Prince's return. The negotiations did not lead to an agreement, and on the night of 11-12 August the 1st Infantry Regiment in Slivnitsa[16] rebelled against the provisional government. By 12 August, the supporters of the coup remained isolated in Sofia and Shumen, after the command of the brigade in Vidin was withdrawn from Clement's government and the commander of the Sliven brigade, Major Avram Gudzev, was arrested. On the same day, a new government headed by Karavelov was formed with the mediation of the Russian Consulate General in Sofia. Gruev relinquished the command and fled the capital with others of the dethroners. The troops who had supported the coup (the Strum and 1st Artillery Regiments) remained for another 3 days in positions near Sofia opposite the 1st Infantry Regiment." #NT!

Fearing civil war and foreign occupation (Russia, Turkey and Serbia were seen as threats), Karavelov and his colleagues demanded that the decision to restore Battenberg to the throne be postponed until a Grand National Assembly could be convened, and that in the meantime the country be governed by a regency. Stambolov, who feared a dictatorship of the Plovdiv military, rejected this proposal and invited the prince (who had been removed from Bulgaria by the dethroners and arrived in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary) to return to the country as soon as possible. On 16 August, the President of the National Assembly issued a new proclamation declaring himself viceroy along with Petko Slaveykov and Georgi Stransky and ordering the Plovdiv troops to seize Sofia. The latter happened on 17 August, after the bloodless withdrawal of the coup troops and the resignation of Karavelov's cabinet. A week later the Strum and 1st Artillery Regiments were disarmed and disbanded in Kyustendil." #NT!

Power was taken over by a regency headed by Stambolov. After the so-called Nine August Coup and the subsequent counter-coup, on 26 August Prince Alexander signed his abdication and appointed a Regency consisting of Stefan Stambolov, Petko Karavelov, Sava Mutkurov. In the complex situation in which it was appointed, the Tarnovo Constitution was violated. The Regency was legalized only at the opening of the 3rd Grand National Assembly. This took place on 24 October 1886 and at the first session P. Karavelov resigned from the post of regent. This forced Stambolov and Mutkurov to resign as well, since the Regency Council was a collective body. On 1 November the 3rd Grand National Assembly elected a new Board of Regents consisting of Stefan Stambolov, Sava Mutkurov, Georgi Zhivkov. In this form the Regency ruled the country until the election of a new Prince on 2 August 1887. As a political institution, the Regency carried out extensive diplomatic activity for the election of a new Bulgarian Prince. A three-member commission, specially elected for this purpose, acted under his direct authority. The Regency also exercised the broad rights conferred on it by the Tarnovo Constitution: it made personal changes in the composition of the Council of Ministers, appointed and dismissed administrative officials, made major changes in the command structure of the army, and exercised all the rights given to the monarchical institution in the legislative, executive and judicial spheres." #NT!

 eoanb_bulgaria.35.d: "Nearly a year after the end of the fighting, relations between Bulgaria and Serbia remained tense, as the Peace of Bucharest left a number of territorial, political and economic issues unresolved. In addition to securing the western border, after the coup and counter-coup in Bulgaria in August 1886, the Regency and the government of Vasil Radoslavov sought reconciliation with Belgrade over the escalation of their conflict with Russia. Foreign Minister Grigor Nachovic's initiative of early September 1886 was actively supported by English diplomacy, which sought a broad anti-Russian alliance in the Balkans. In Serbia, where like in Bulgaria there were strong Russophile sentiments, the dethronement of Alexander Battenberg was interpreted as the work of Russia, which could be repeated in Belgrade. This was the main motive for King Milan and the Austrophile government of the Advance to respond to the invitation to negotiate. The contact was actively mediated by English diplomatic agents in both countries. Following a visit by the Serbian emissary Pera Todorovic to Sofia at the end of September, on 13 October the Bulgarian envoy Georgi Stransky and the Serbian foreign minister Dragutin Franasovic signed an agreement in Niš. The Niš agreement set the conditions for settling some of the most important issues in bilateral relations: the disputed territory at Bregovo was declared neutral. A joint commission is established to redraw the border along the lower Timok. It was decided that Serbian political emigrants in Bulgaria should be kept away from the common border, and a similar injunction was imposed on Bulgarian emigrants in Serbia." #NT!

On 1 November a change in the composition of the Regency took place.\n\nThe Bulgarian delegation has a ten-day stay in Vienna, where it finds a warm welcome from the Foreign Minister Kalnoki. Austria-Hungary, which is in formal alliance with Russia, has also recently expressed reservations about St Petersburg's aggressive policy. During their stay, they managed to get to know Prince Ferdinand Saxe-Coburggotsky. He made a good impression and gave the impression of being a suitable candidate for Bulgarian prince. The Bulgarian delegation continued on to other European capitals. In Berlin and Paris they are advised to be more yielding to Russian demands, while in Rome and London they encourage their resistance.\n\nIn February 1887 riots of the Russophile officers broke out in Ruse and Silistra. They were suppressed by government, and the leaders of the revolt were sentenced to death by a military court. Among them were heroes of the Serbo-Bulgarian War such as Major Uzunov and Major Panov. In the following days, prominent Bulgarian politicians were arrested from opposition, such as Karavelov, Rizov, Ivan Slaveykov, etc. The rulers understood that on this instability had to end and decided to elect a prince, without the prior approval of the Great Powers." #NT!

Waldemar of Denmark had been a candidate for the Bulgarian throne as early as 1879.

However, under pressure from the Russian Emperor Alexander III, Prince Valdemar telegraphed his abdication of the Bulgarian crown on 11 November. As his wife Princess Maria stated, "nothing could make me go there" (to Bulgaria - b.r.). The prolonged crownlessness, threatening Bulgaria's sovereignty, forced the Supreme National Assembly to elect the compromise candidacy of Ferdinand I as prince. Prince Valdemar had four sons - Princes Augé, Axel, Eric and Vigo, and one daughter - Princess Marguerite (married to Prince René of Bourbon-Parma). In the first half of the 20th century, he was one of the most respected representatives of the royal dynasties in Europe, he was called the "Uncle of Kings"." #NT!
