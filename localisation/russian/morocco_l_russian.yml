 MOR_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Morocco is navigating a turbulent era marked by internal and external pressures. The country struggles with political fragmentation, economic difficulties, and an outdated military structure. The ruling Alaouite dynasty faces challenges in maintaining authority, and the need for modernization is increasingly pressing.\n\nExternally, European powers, particularly France and Spain, are expanding their influence in North Africa, viewing Morocco's strategic Atlantic and Mediterranean coastline as a valuable prize. The threat of foreign intervention looms as European interests grow, putting Morocco's sovereignty at risk.\n\nAt this crossroads, Morocco's leadership must balance the push for reform with the preservation of its independence as the country grapples with the demands of modernization and the risk of colonial encroachment. How it navigates these pressures will be crucial in shaping its future trajectory." #NT!

 MOR_bled_es_siba: "Bled es-Siba" #NT!
 MOR_bled_es_siba_desc: "Control over various regions and vassals has been tenious throughtout the years. The Sultan's nominal control beyond the Atlas mountains is nothing but a mere facade and many subjects act almost independently of the central goverment in Fes." #NT!

Yet the focus of these efforts were more towards large and important centers of trade or key cities across the country focusing less in the rural and many times harser countryside.

While we won and they retreated back to their puny colonies they had shown to had learned from their previous invasion and switched tactics. Instead of trying to divide or conquer us by force the their shady strategies have evolved to seemingly beneficial bussiness offers from companies which thay are the main benefactors.

Yet the Ottomans and Egyptians wile being on the periphery still are more advanced than the rest of the world and have adopted many European institutions.

With modern equipment and a team of engineers taught abroad with their only intention of helping the nation it has come time to finally kickstart our entry into the industrial era once and for all. We now no longer rely on the ever more unreliable European trade for machine parts and trains since an opening of our own factories will begin the domestic industry they so desperatly try to deny from us. This day marks a vital first step for the grand vision of the sultan of one day standing up to the Great powers and establishing our own shpere of influence as to protect the Maghreb and the Sahara from those ruthless imprerialist in London and Paris. We are a shining example and an upcoming regional player that is now more than ever starting to break the ropes of the colonizers and experience true economic and political independence.

The printing press has proven to be a vital asset in any goverment and the massive spread of information that it produces is now more important than ever.

Yet although the persistance of our people is admirable we must recognise the change in times and start to move along a newer and perhabs better direction. Just as we thought we had enough new problems arise and with them new solutions need to be undertaken. The argicultural sector has sadly been one of the most stagnant institutions of our country and reforms had not implimented until the Europeans arrived. Yet we have seen what overeliance on the imperialist powers brings and thus we will work on our own unique path towards a brighter future. Reforms based on previous European inventions will be taken but we will not allow anyone to take even an inch of farming land of a Morrocan citizen." #NT!

But with new advancements in technology as time progressed our people slowly began to migrate inland and inland as time moved on. Yet after centuries of gradual immigration inwards there still are areas very sparsly populated or unihabited. With new technologies better communication and faster as well as easier travel we can take advantage of all the lands that have been given to us and start a second gradual phase of investment and immigration further in." #NT!

 MOR_european_cotton_plantations_desc: "As an ex-colony ourselves we have remained unhinged about our attitude towards Europe. But there is no doubt that the industrial powers despite our efforts towards slow technological progress still have a better quality and quantity of products such as cotton which we so much need. Despite the reason for these developments being clearly colonization and imperialism of other peoples just like us our cotton farms are inferior in quality to those in Europe or their colonies. Turning a blind eye this time and trading with them is ultimatly the best move as our soils are not suited for these kinds of crops and a shortage in cotton will put our economy and people in a lot of harships." #NT!
