 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier: "Enact the Olliver Law" #NT!
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier_desc: "Proposed by the liberal politician Émile Ollivier, this law will allow the repeal of the 1791 law Le Chapellier that made the rallying of peasants and workers illegal. Viewed as a first step towards a friendlier government for the poor class, its enactment will calm down the republicans and the socialist movement." #NT!
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy: "Enact the Duruy Law" #NT!
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy_desc: "The law proposed by Victor Duruy aims to improve schooling. After debate the law content is the following :\n- Obligation to have an elementary school in all towns with more 500 inhabitants (800 in the Falloux Law 1850)\n- Improvement of the teacher salaries\n- The towns, the Departments and France can finance elementary otherwise the parents pay to send their children.\n- Authorisation of towns to give money to hardworking children to improve school frequentation (school stays facultative to keep father liberty).\n- History and Geography are mandatory" #NT!
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel: "Enact the Niel Law" #NT!
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel_desc: "The War Minister, the Marshal Adolphe Niel shares with Napoleon III the admiration of the Prussian military administration. In Prussia all men between 20 and 40 must do military service. In France, conscription is still done by lottery and the rich can pay other to serve in their place to avoid it. Even if the number of active soldiers of both countries are comparable, the French Army must divide its soldiers between colonies and the reserve is not ready to fight. Adolphe Niel estimated that there are 200,000 French soldiers who can defend the Rhine against up to 350,000 Prussians (double with the reserve). Adolphe Niel proposed the \"Garde Nationale mobile\" a copy of the Prussian military system, but the people and the deputies don’t want it." #NT!

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment_desc: "France is, as all other nations, dependent on the exchange of trade between peoples. In the recognition of this truth, an interesting proposition has come forth from within trade commissions and economic circles...\n\nA typical inconvenience in international trade are unfixed exchange rates between currencies, as each currency follows its own standards of minting, weighing and metal composition. This leads to exchange uncertainty, as a trader in France may not get the value of goods for the weight of his coin abroad. Thusly, a proposal for a so-called 'Monetary Union' has been presented.\n\nThis 'Union' would, if agreed upon by other nations, standardize exchange rates between nations. This would make it so that coins from abroad can be exchanged for the French Franc at a set equal value, per bimetallic standard, both ways. This would make trade a much simpler and effective affair, but requires some fellow nations to participate... shall we form this Monetary Union?" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece: "Ask Greece to join us!" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece_desc: "The Greeks have expressed an interest in joining the LMU, citing one of the clauses of the treaty which allows nations willing to abide by the treaty's stipulations to join the union's member states.

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia: "Bilateral agreement with Russia" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia_desc: "While St. Petersburg has expressed no desire in joining the treaty, the interest of the equal exchange concept has not fallen on deaf ears it seems. A separate agreement may be able to be struck, however, but with exchange rates being standardized from banks of the member unions in relation to the Bank of Russia, with regards to fiscal and monetary notes. This agreement, while different, could make trade simpler for our partners in Russia." #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain: "Bilateral agreement with Spain" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain_desc: "Spain is doubtful of the implications of the treaty, and negotiations have thusfar been fruitless despite interest in the concept.

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania_desc: "The newly founded nation of the Romani people have expressed an interest in our currency union, and is willing to enter as a member. However, disagreements in treaty application and organization has lead to unsuccessful negotiations, and Romania remains outside the agreement. Despite the concessions, perhaps we can persuade the Romanians with a modified bilateral agreement?" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary: "Bilateral agreement with Austria-Hungary" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary_desc: "Vienna has expressed a clear rejection of the LMU treaty and its stipulations, reasoning that a bimetallic monetary system is not appealing to their economic interests, as their own system is that of a monometallic monetary system.

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco: "Bilateral agreement with Monaco" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco_desc: "Our small neighbour in the south, Monaco, is tied to us in a way that is inseverable.

An agreement would be most beneficial for us both." #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia: "Unilateral agreement with Serbia" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia_desc: "The Serbians are not interested in participating directly in the union and its exchanges, but has shown to want to make use of the LMU standard for coin minting.

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria: "Unilateral agreement with Bulgaria" #NT!
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria, much like Serbia, does not want to enter the union but does want to use the LMU standardization of minting.

It is clear that this invitation from Victor Emanuel II to the Emperor Napoleon illustrates this rapprochement, which could perhaps lead to a major change, one day, in Italy.\n\nBut today, there was no question of major upheaval in the history of Sardinia-Piedmont, but simply to lay the first stone of a railway bridge between the two nations, proof of the dynamism and modernity of our brilliant Empire." #NT!

In 1859, a doctor an amateurish astronom, Edmond Modeste Lescarbault sent a letter to Le Verrier to report an observation of a corps.

This meaning the coins are united in value and are usable without conversion in all member nations, as long as the dimensions, weight and metal compositions remain mostly identical.

 third_rep_france.006.d: "The French Army has been unable to stop the Prussian advance, and now, they surround the capital completely.

It is time to call the Prussian high command, and to discuss the terms for peace.\n\nThe location was chosen to be the Ferrières Castle, east of Paris. It will, and has, to stay secret, to protect the stability of the new French government, and to assure that the terms discussed will be debated fairly.

Confronted to the might of the German armies, they have now asked us to discuss peace in the Ferrières Castle near Paris. This discussion with the French foreign minister will let us push our demands.\n\nWe have for decades longed for the time we could retake the lands of Alsace-Lorraine, German lands which we are legitimate to claim. On top of that, we could use the opportunity to strengthen our German unity. Beating the French Empire is a gift on its own, but this the closest we expect to have from a capitulation.

We shall renounce to the territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which will be transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia. Peace is vital for France, the war has destroyed a lot of lives already, but these terms are very restraining and may be problematic. But we must do what's needed to save France from an ever growing disaster. We must agree to these terms. But first, we must prepare ourselves from what might come.

 third_rep_france.008.d: "The siege of Paris won't stop our politicians from organizing the rest of the nation! The new Minister of the Interior, the socialist Léon Gambetta, has jumped into a balloon to quit the city. The aim of such a surprising move, is to organize the French Army that are awaiting orders from the government since the start of the siege.\n\nWhat could be seen as an extravagant and excentric way of leaving a city, is in reality probably the best way for him to leave, and to go behind enemy lines. Of course this isn't without risk, but Gambetta is the type of politician that would risk being shot by a Prussian, if it's to save the nation." #NT!

 third_rep_france.009.d: "The siege continues, and the people are getting tired of the poor performance of the newly formed government. A recent streak of military losses, due to a lack of long term planning and quick response tactics, has prompted new insurrections in the capital. Charles Delescluze has called in his newspaper to form the Commune, and to fight against the government.\n\nThis small scale uprising won't topple our government, but it has been the rallying cause for a few of our government members, like Léon Gambetta and Henri Rochefort. Rochefort wants us to accept this uprising as a normal response to a time of crisis, and let them continue. The army however, don't want to deal with internal threats at the same time as the Prussian Army." #NT!

France has suffered again and again losses on the battlefield, and the government continues to resist the terms given by the Prussians for peace. However, these past few days have been too much for general Trochu. He has today announced his resignation from the government.

Rochefort was a great voice, bridging the gap between the communist Blanquists and the moderate government. While he often went against our main republican lines, he still was an important figure of the French Republic. But we don't need authoritarians in our new government, and Rochefort's departure will not make our job any harder than what it already is." #NT!

 third_rep_france.014.d: "A glorious day for the republic, it's election time! These elections will decide the landscape of our first Parliament, giving an advantage to one of the four major parties present in France and powerful enough to have representatives.\n\nThe Legitimists are the monarchists, supporters of the return to a more classical French monarchy. This party has lots of supporters among the conservative circles, but isn't very popular among the population. The Modérés are, like their name suggest, more moderate conservatives. Supporters of the republic, they still have very conservative views and politics. The Liberals are centrist politicians, who are keen to pleasing everyone. Keeping stability in the new republic might not be a bad idea after all. Finally, the Radicals are socialist poltilicans, pushing for a more centralized economy and for a more welfare-centric nation. Extremly popular, it is also a party that could calm down the recent problems we have with communists insurgencies." #NT!

During the July Monarchy, he erected what was later called the "Thiers Wall" to protect the city from invaders following the 1848 revolution. Not only that, but he also has shown some resentment towards the National Guards, fearing that they might rise up to oust him. Now his fears might become true.

The illustrious military officier is also a staunch legitimist, and a man with great influence on the army. While we can't accuse him of conspiracy, it is true that we could remove him swiftly, resolving the problem very elegantly. However, our army is already at its weakest point in decades, some may even say centuries, and thus removing one of the most efficient military officer from our army might completly destroy us.
