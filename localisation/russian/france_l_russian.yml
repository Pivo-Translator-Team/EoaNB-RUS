 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier: "Enact the Olliver Law" 
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_ollivier_desc: "Proposed by the liberal politician Émile Ollivier, this law will allow the repeal of the 1791 law Le Chapellier that made the rallying of peasants and workers illegal. Viewed as a first step towards a friendlier government for the poor class, its enactment will calm down the republicans and the socialist movement." 
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy: "Enact the Duruy Law" 
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_duruy_desc: "The law proposed by Victor Duruy aims to improve schooling. After debate the law content is the following :\n- Obligation to have an elementary school in all towns with more 500 inhabitants (800 in the Falloux Law 1850)\n- Improvement of the teacher salaries\n- The towns, the Departments and France can finance elementary otherwise the parents pay to send their children.\n- Authorisation of towns to give money to hardworking children to improve school frequentation (school stays facultative to keep father liberty).\n- History and Geography are mandatory" 
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel: "Enact the Niel Law" 
 FRA_decision_enact_loi_niel_desc: "The War Minister, the Marshal Adolphe Niel shares with Napoleon III the admiration of the Prussian military administration. In Prussia all men between 20 and 40 must do military service. In France, conscription is still done by lottery and the rich can pay other to serve in their place to avoid it. Even if the number of active soldiers of both countries are comparable, the French Army must divide its soldiers between colonies and the reserve is not ready to fight. Adolphe Niel estimated that there are 200,000 French soldiers who can defend the Rhine against up to 350,000 Prussians (double with the reserve). Adolphe Niel proposed the \"Garde Nationale mobile\" a copy of the Prussian military system, but the people and the deputies don’t want it."

 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment: "Founding Treaty of Latin Monetary Union" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_establishment_desc: "France is, as all other nations, dependent on the exchange of trade between peoples. In the recognition of this truth, an interesting proposition has come forth from within trade commissions and economic circles...\n\nA typical inconvenience in international trade are unfixed exchange rates between currencies, as each currency follows its own standards of minting, weighing and metal composition. This leads to exchange uncertainty, as a trader in France may not get the value of goods for the weight of his coin abroad. Thusly, a proposal for a so-called 'Monetary Union' has been presented.\n\nThis 'Union' would, if agreed upon by other nations, standardize exchange rates between nations. This would make it so that coins from abroad can be exchanged for the French Franc at a set equal value, per bimetallic standard, both ways. This would make trade a much simpler and effective affair, but requires some fellow nations to participate... shall we form this Monetary Union?" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece: "Ask Greece to join us!" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_greece_desc: "The Greeks have expressed an interest in joining the LMU, citing one of the clauses of the treaty which allows nations willing to abide by the treaty's stipulations to join the union's member states. The Kingdom of Greece lies in a valuable position to contest the waters along the Bosphorus, and letting them into the union may work just as much as a diplomatic move as an economic one... shall Greece enter the Monetary Union?" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia: "Bilateral agreement with Russia" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_russia_desc: "While St. Petersburg has expressed no desire in joining the treaty, the interest of the equal exchange concept has not fallen on deaf ears it seems. A separate agreement may be able to be struck, however, but with exchange rates being standardized from banks of the member unions in relation to the Bank of Russia, with regards to fiscal and monetary notes. This agreement, while different, could make trade simpler for our partners in Russia." 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain: "Bilateral agreement with Spain" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_spain_desc: "Spain is doubtful of the implications of the treaty, and negotiations have thusfar been fruitless despite interest in the concept. A bilateral agreement might be beneficial as a replacement to union membership, even if the agreement has to be slightly slanted to the Spaniards..." 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania: "Bilateral agreement with Romania" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_romania_desc: "The newly founded nation of the Romani people have expressed an interest in our currency union, and is willing to enter as a member. However, disagreements in treaty application and organization has lead to unsuccessful negotiations, and Romania remains outside the agreement. Despite the concessions, perhaps we can persuade the Romanians with a modified bilateral agreement?" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary: "Bilateral agreement with Austria-Hungary" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_austria_hungary_desc: "Vienna has expressed a clear rejection of the LMU treaty and its stipulations, reasoning that a bimetallic monetary system is not appealing to their economic interests, as their own system is that of a monometallic monetary system. Maybe we could persuade them with an agreement of equal exchange between our gold Francs and their Florin between treasuries?" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco: "Bilateral agreement with Monaco" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_monaco_desc: "Our small neighbour in the south, Monaco, is tied to us in a way that is inseverable. They do not want a full membership in our union, but have expressed a positive desire to make use of the LMU standard for trade between currencies. An agreement would be most beneficial for us both." 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia: "Unilateral agreement with Serbia" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_serbia_desc: "The Serbians are not interested in participating directly in the union and its exchanges, but has shown to want to make use of the LMU standard for coin minting. While we can't make them abide by our standardization and exchange rate due to metal percentages being different, we could perhaps set special exchange rates between their standard and ours?" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria: "Unilateral agreement with Bulgaria" 
 FRA_latin_monetary_union_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria, much like Serbia, does not want to enter the union but does want to use the LMU standardization of minting. We could make a unilateral agreement which would exchange union currency at a rate which is equal to the value of the Bulgarian coins; all we need to know is if the Bulgarian's will agree to this or not..."

On the other side of the Alps, Carvour, President of the Sardinian Council of Ministers, has tried to maintain good diplomatic relations with the Empire since the Sardinian participation in the Crimean War of 1853. It is clear that this invitation from Victor Emanuel II to the Emperor Napoleon illustrates this rapprochement, which could perhaps lead to a major change, one day, in Italy.\n\nBut today, there was no question of major upheaval in the history of Sardinia-Piedmont, but simply to lay the first stone of a railway bridge between the two nations, proof of the dynamism and modernity of our brilliant Empire."

The British John Couch Adams worked on it but it was the French Urbain Le Verrier which computed the orbit of this unknown planet in 1845. The Prussian Johann Gottfried Galle observed the planet in 1846 which will be called Neptune. Urbain Le Verrier tried to do the same thing do explain anomalies with Mercury orbit. In 1859, a doctor an amateurish astronom, Edmond Modeste Lescarbault sent a letter to Le Verrier to report an observation of a corps.

It could be an occasion for Italy to get Venetia and Napoleon III to become the mediator who once again redraws Europe, but without a fight. If it comes down to choosing between the 2 German powers, Prussia is a better choice because of the inefficient Austrian alliance during the time of Napoleon I.

Austria will be totally isolated if we ensure France will not help it and if Italy is with us. Napoleon III said it is possible if Venetia is given to Italian. But what he wants for him? Luxembourg?

The transfer of the land came with the condition of neutrality of the territory in european diplomacy, this allowed them to gain the support of the neighboring Switzerland and Italy that backs the treaty, saying that France has no right to impose rule over neutral land.

An eerie silence sweeps over the area, followed by a screeching explosion. A small bomb had been thrown below the horses of the lancers, sending the stallions fleeing from the streets. The crowds that had gathered gasped at the disturbance, as cries of panic followed en suite. Not a moment later, does the choir of screeches strum again, as a second bomb lands below the hitch and a third below the emperor's sedan, turning it on its side and shattering the glass windows. The screeches turn to cries as the guards race to the sedan and open the car door..."

 nap_france.399.d: "After years battling both Prussians and illness, the emperor Napoléon III Bonaparte has finally passed away. His reign was tumultuous, and wasn't very popular, but he has inspired France greatly, and brought modernity and industrialism into a nation that was struggling to find stabiltiy.\n\nHis son, Napoléon Eugène, is the imperial heir for the throne. While he might never rule France, he still has taken the title of "Napoléon IV", a title recognized by many Bonapartites already." 
 nap_france.399.a: "Long live Napoleon IV !"

 nap_france.400.d: "Most urban renovations took place during the Second Empire. The prefect of Rhône and Mayor of Lyon Vaïsse undertook these large transformations, similar to Haussmann's in Paris, the reason being the prestige and security of the city. His work was supported by different people: the Chief Engineer of the Roads, appointed in 1854, Gustave Bonnet and the architect Benoit Poncet, who designed the Imperial Street (now Rue de la République) in the 1850s."

 nap_france.401.d: "The XIXth century was for France the century of great projects and great achievements. From 1840, Marseille launched a major counstruction program never before seen in the history of the city. One the most important investments was Rue Imperiale. Almost 2.500 workers were involved in the building. On the 15th of August, 1864, Rue Imperiale was inaugurated in the presence of Napoleon III. After the fall of the Second Empire, it became Rue de la Republique."

 nap_france.1610.d: "The Manufacture d'Armes de Châtellerault ("Châtellerault Weapons Factory"), often abbreviated to MAC, is the French state-owned weapons manufacturer in the dearly town of Châtellerault, Vienne. Construction began by royal decree on July 14, 1819, with the purpose of sword manufacturing. Recent plans for renovation to include the production of firearms and cannons by the company owners have come to light, and they have recently been given the greenlight to start on the great reconstruction project."

Dozens of workers in need of jobs have come to this project and deemed it an economic miracle for the town of Châtellerault. Renovation finished by expected time, and the predicted cost was spot-on. This great factory has now been brought towards the days of new and away from production of old."

 latin_monetary_union.1.d: "Today, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland have made a joint statement addressing the conclusion of discussions, and the founding of a new treaty union: The Latin Monetary Union.\n\nThe Latin Monetary Union, abreviated as the LMU, seeks to unify the currency of each member-state under one standardized system of mintage. This system makes the exchange rates of coinage between the members Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and France equal. This meaning the coins are united in value and are usable without conversion in all member nations, as long as the dimensions, weight and metal compositions remain mostly identical. The Union was a proposal made by French officials, and its founding would suggest a closer cooperation between each member-state's and French economic interests in Europe.\n\nWhat will become of this union over the ages, only time will tell..." 
 latin_monetary_union.1.a: "A union is born!" 
 latin_monetary_union.2.t: "Ask Greece to join Latin Monetary Union" 
 latin_monetary_union.2.d: "Our diplomats to Greece have reported a possibility to invite the Greeks into joining the FMU.\n\nFeelers among the diplomatic corps sent to Greece have gotten positive impressions of the potential prospects of a Greek entry into the FMU, and believe that giving them a direct invitation might be a good way to give off a good impression about the LMU. The Greeks are generally positive about the stipulations of the treaty, and have shown an definitive interest in the coinage standardization which the LMU offers, besides the currency having the strength of the other members economic backing.\n\nThere are many potential benefits for the Greeks if they decide to fully enter the monetary union, however, the decision ultimately falls to them." 
 latin_monetary_union.2.a: "Send our greetings!" 
 latin_monetary_union.3.t: "Bilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union" 
 latin_monetary_union.3.d: "We do not agree with all the stipulations that the LMU imposes if we were to join as a full member, thusly making the treaty undesirable for our continued interest.\n\nHowever, while we aren't interested in joining the LMU as a full member-state it would still be prudent and a definitive necessity to interact with it on an economic basis. The standardizing of mintage and coinage is an appealing idea, but perhaps there are other ways of making a set exchange rate for our treasury or currency in relations to the LMU?\n\nThis way we could trade with the LMU on more equal terms without joining the union in full." 
 latin_monetary_union.3.a: "A bilateral agreement is desirable" 
 latin_monetary_union.3.b: "We do not want this" 
 latin_monetary_union.4.t: "Unilateral agreement with Latin Monetary Union" 
 latin_monetary_union.4.d: "The LMU system of coinage is an interesting idea which could be used to our advantage, despite us not being interested in the treaty. Perhaps we could make our own standard of exchange by the LMU system for our own purposes, while getting an agreement to make use of such a system in relation to exchange rates to the LMU and other associates with similar systems? This would give us the advantage of making a coinage which is usable for trade across many nations in Europe, while being more tailored to our own purposes."

 third_rep_france.003.a: "Here we go Again" 
  
 third_rep_france.004.t: "Canons for the Parisians" 
 third_rep_france.004.d: "In these times of crisis, the Parisians joined forces to buy cannons with their money to defend their city from the German invader. These weapons may help repel the enemy."

 third_rep_france.005.t: "The Parisian National Guard joigned the front" 
 third_rep_france.005.d: "All registered voters of the city of Paris are summoned. The National Guards, numbering 590,000 soldiers, were mobilized for the rest of the war and sent en masse to the front. They also participate in the defense of Paris." 
 third_rep_france.005.a: "All citizens must fight" 
  
 third_rep_france.006.t: "The Siege of Paris" 
 third_rep_france.006.d: "The French Army has been unable to stop the Prussian advance, and now, they surround the capital completely. This siege was something the generals knew was going to happen, but like often during this war the ineffectiveness and lack of preparation from the Army will lead to difficult times for the Parisians.\n\nHopefully, the Prussians will be pushed back soon enough." 
 third_rep_france.006.a: "This is not over !" 
  
 third_rep_france.007.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières" 
 third_rep_france.007.d: "The war is now over for us. We have lost, and the Prussians crushed us under the might of their united German army. It is time to call the Prussian high command, and to discuss the terms for peace.\n\nThe location was chosen to be the Ferrières Castle, east of Paris. It will, and has, to stay secret, to protect the stability of the new French government, and to assure that the terms discussed will be debated fairly. The Prussian chancellor and the French foreign ministers will discuss the terms for peace, and hopefully, they will find something both sides can agree on." 
 third_rep_france.007.a: "We hope to bring peace" 
  
 third_rep_france.0071.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières" 
 third_rep_france.0071.d: "We have received a message from the newly formed French government, we have finally made them bend the knee. Confronted to the might of the German armies, they have now asked us to discuss peace in the Ferrières Castle near Paris. This discussion with the French foreign minister will let us push our demands.\n\nWe have for decades longed for the time we could retake the lands of Alsace-Lorraine, German lands which we are legitimate to claim. On top of that, we could use the opportunity to strengthen our German unity. Beating the French Empire is a gift on its own, but this the closest we expect to have from a capitulation. We have our demands, and they'll have to accept it." 
 third_rep_france.0071.a: "The war needs to cease, we won already after all" 
  
 third_rep_france.0072.t: "Entrevue de Ferrières" 
 third_rep_france.0072.d: "The Prussian chancellor has agreed to peace, but with horrendous terms. We shall renounce to the territory of Alsace-Lorraine, which will be transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia. Peace is vital for France, the war has destroyed a lot of lives already, but these terms are very restraining and may be problematic. But we must do what's needed to save France from an ever growing disaster. We must agree to these terms. But first, we must prepare ourselves from what might come. Let us take the time to carefully think about these terms."

 third_rep_france.008.t: "Léon Gambetta leaves Paris in a balloon" 
 third_rep_france.008.d: "The siege of Paris won't stop our politicians from organizing the rest of the nation! The new Minister of the Interior, the socialist Léon Gambetta, has jumped into a balloon to quit the city. The aim of such a surprising move, is to organize the French Army that are awaiting orders from the government since the start of the siege.\n\nWhat could be seen as an extravagant and excentric way of leaving a city, is in reality probably the best way for him to leave, and to go behind enemy lines. Of course this isn't without risk, but Gambetta is the type of politician that would risk being shot by a Prussian, if it's to save the nation." 
 third_rep_france.008.a: "At least it must be fun" 
  
 third_rep_france.0081.t: "Government delegation sent in Tours" 
 third_rep_france.0081.d: "The government having chosen to remain in Paris surrounded by Prussian troops and their allies, a delegation was sent to Tours to coordinate the action in the provinces under the orders of Adolphe Crémieux, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Alexandre Glais-Bizoin and Admiral Fourichon."

 third_rep_france.0083.t: "Government delegation captured in Bordeaux !" 
 third_rep_france.0083.d: "It's a catastrophe! Without warning, in the middle of the night, the Prusian army made a Perseus in the French defense and entered the city of Bordeaux where the government delegation was now prisoners of the Prussians! The signing of the armistice should be concluded in the afternoon ..." 
 third_rep_france.0083.a: "This is the end !" 
  
 third_rep_france.009.t: "Insurrections in Paris" 
 third_rep_france.009.d: "The siege continues, and the people are getting tired of the poor performance of the newly formed government. A recent streak of military losses, due to a lack of long term planning and quick response tactics, has prompted new insurrections in the capital. Charles Delescluze has called in his newspaper to form the Commune, and to fight against the government.\n\nThis small scale uprising won't topple our government, but it has been the rallying cause for a few of our government members, like Léon Gambetta and Henri Rochefort. Rochefort wants us to accept this uprising as a normal response to a time of crisis, and let them continue. The army however, don't want to deal with internal threats at the same time as the Prussian Army." 
 third_rep_france.009.a: "Put down this insurrection"

 third_rep_france.0102.d: "The Parisians have spoken! The national defense government did not obtain the majority in the vote. General Trochu is expected to decide the fate of the government very soon." 
 third_rep_france.0102.a: "This is the End" 
  
 third_rep_france.0103.t: "Louis Jules Trochu steps down"

These elections will decide the landscape of our first Parliament, giving an advantage to one of the four major parties present in France and powerful enough to have representatives.\n\nThe Legitimists are the monarchists, supporters of the return to a more classical French monarchy. This party has lots of supporters among the conservative circles, but isn't very popular among the population. The Modérés are, like their name suggest, more moderate conservatives. Supporters of the republic, they still have very conservative views and politics. The Liberals are centrist politicians, who are keen to pleasing everyone. Keeping stability in the new republic might not be a bad idea after all. Finally, the Radicals are socialist poltilicans, pushing for a more centralized economy and for a more welfare-centric nation. Extremly popular, it is also a party that could calm down the recent problems we have with communists insurgencies."

 third_rep_france.15.d_thiers: "Adolphe Thiers has been in French politics for years before becoming the President. During the July Monarchy, he erected what was later called the "Thiers Wall" to protect the city from invaders following the 1848 revolution. Not only that, but he also has shown some resentment towards the National Guards, fearing that they might rise up to oust him. Now his fears might become true. Rumors are going around that they are planning to take over the government. They are socialists at heart, the very young republic might get destroyed once again, we cannot let that happen." 
 third_rep_france.15.d_gambetta: "Léon Gambetta is a popular figure, both for the republicans and the socialists. He is charismatic, and has made clear that nobody is going to stop his societal reforms following his election. But both the Military and the Socialists want to be assured of his policies. The military fears that he'll be too liberal, the socialist fear that he will be too conservative to please the majority. Léon Gambetta is in a tough position, and has to choose which faction he wants to help, and which faction he needs to betray." 
 third_rep_france.15.d_rochefort: "The first President of our new Republic is not the most popular one among our socialist peers. Henri Rochefort has shown himself to be a quite ruthless and authoritarian leader, and on top of that someone who frequent Auguste Blanqui, a known hard-line marxist. The French army has already expressed their worries about this new ruler, and Patrice de Mac-Mahon has become the most prominent opponent to Rochefort among the military. Intelligence reports show the suspicious behavior of some of our war veterans."

 third_rep_france.16.d: "Recent governmental decisions were unsatisfying for parts of the Army. The recent confiscation of the guns of our National Guard, in the hopes of controlling a situation that would have spiraled down, has made them join the socialist cause. Reports are talking about an insurrection, but lot of experts in the government are already talking about a revolution.\n\nBrace yourself Paris, the struggle is far from being over." 
 third_rep_france.16.a: "It has begun"

 third_rep_france.17.d: "Following the arrest of Patrice de Mac-Mahon, parts of our miltiary have risen up against our government and has declared war on our régime. Their headquarters are in Bordeaux, and they are already making offensives along the Garonne to secure their hold of Aquitaine. Our high command is completly taken by surprise, and troops are reorganized erratically with what's left of our generals and commanders. So little time after the Franco-Prussian War that humiliated France, we now have to face another conflict."

 third_rep_france.18.d: "The communist group of Auguste Blanqui has been a pain for the French government since it was called to replace the imperial regime. However, recent problematic military moves has prompted the need for a political deal, a compromise.\n\nBlanqui proposed that we should get rid of general Patrice de Mac-Mahon. The illustrious military officier is also a staunch legitimist, and a man with great influence on the army. While we can't accuse him of conspiracy, it is true that we could remove him swiftly, resolving the problem very elegantly. However, our army is already at its weakest point in decades, some may even say centuries, and thus removing one of the most efficient military officer from our army might completly destroy us. This is an ultimatum in disguise, either we remove Mac-Mahon and face a possible military uprising, or we let him continue and we face a socialist uprising. There's no right solution here." 
 third_rep_france.18.a: "We'll be sure to eliminate Mac-Mahon"

 third_rep_france.19.d: "The disastrous French government hasn't managed to keep its own Army under their command. In a move only outshined by the continuous conflict against Prussia, parts of the French Army, led by general Patrice de Mac-Mahon, has risen up and has called their own government of national salvation down in Aquitaine. We now have another enemy to face, our own army, and without these key miltiary commanders we are now even weaker than before." 
 third_rep_france.19.a: "Rochefort has seen it coming" 
  
 third_rep_france.20.t: "The Worries of the Socialists" 
 third_rep_france.20.d: "The socialists have called upon us to stregthen the basics of our nascent democracy, and to protect at all cost the social liberties gained by the end of the rule of the Emperor. It is too early to make rock-strong promises, but it's probably what's needed to keep our nation in one piece. However, giving in too much to them might anger an already frustrated army."

 third_rep_france.26.t: "The Army is worried about our decisions" 
 third_rep_france.26.d: "The revent decisions taken by the government about the worries of its people and army hasn't been popular among the influencial military commanders.

Our military has been weakened enough, we don't need such demonstrations, but it seems that we have lost them for good now. Negotiations were tried, but ultimatly failed. It seems that we must live with an even more weakened Army."
