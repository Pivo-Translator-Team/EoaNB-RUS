 	# IDEAS 
 CAU_fighters: "Кавказский Газават"
 CAU_fighters_desc: "Газва (множественное число Газават) — это битва или набег на немусульман; народы Кавказа объединились под влиянием ислама, чтобы противостоять российскому вторжению — они делают это посредством нерегулярных боевых действий, которые особенно эффективны в горной местности Черкесии и Дагестана."
 CAU_muridism: "Мюридизм"
 CAU_muridism_desc: "Мюридизм был военно-политической идеологией северных кавказцев с 1820-х по 1860-е годы. Он был направлен на объединение всех кавказских мусульман (тем самым устраняя раскол, вызванный различными школами ислама, существовавшими на Кавказе) в священной войне за свободу против русских захватчиков. Мюридизм был глубоко укоренен в исламской вере и использовался для построения современного, эффективного, единого и централизованного государства. (Он представлен в игре национальными идеями и законами)."
 CAU_fierce_resistance: "Ожесточенное сопротивление"
 CAU_fierce_resistance_weak: "Ожесточенное сопротивление"
 CAU_nomadic_artillery: "Бей-и-беги"
 CAU_nomadic_artillery_desc: "Для царских войск нововведения Талхига оказались совершенно неожиданными. Артиллерия Талхига была практически неуловимой: дав несколько выстрелов из пушек по царским войскам, он быстро перемещался на конном экипаже в другое место, откуда снова наносил урон русским. Это повторялось периодически. Драгуны и казаки, прибежавшие на звук выстрелов, не обнаружили артиллерии на месте. Русские называли такую ​​тактику горцев «кочевой артиллерией»."
 CAU_supply_node_nerf: "Опора на местную поддержку"

It has enlisted the services of Dr. Millingen, who would become the Quarantine Officer at Trabzon, to distribute the collected funds appropriately among the refugees in Istanbul. Dr. Millingen has been sending regular updates to the Press back home in the hope that more support would be attracted by his accounts of the refugees’ suffering. Contributions were sent over as soon as they came in, “since every pound sent at once may save a life”." #NT!
