 ### COUNTRY DESCRIPTION ### 
  
 TUN_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC: "Tunisia, a semi-autonomous state under the Ottoman Empire, faces a turbulent period marked by political instability, corruption, and a stagnant agrarian economy. Beys, from the Husainid dynasty, struggled to govern effectively, and urgent reforms were needed. Meanwhile, European powers, especially France and Italy, eye Tunisia’s strategic Mediterranean location, posing a growing threat of foreign intervention.\n\nTunisia stands at a crossroads, balancing modernization efforts with the need to protect its autonomy, as internal challenges and external pressures shape its uncertain future." #NT!
  
 ### LEADERS DESCRIPTION ### 
  
 POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_II_IBN_AL_HUSAYN: "Muhammad II is the Eleventh Bey of the Husainid Dynasty. As Heir Apparent, he had excelled in military affairs and earned the rank of Divisional General within the Ottoman Army in August 1840. He was further promoted to Marshal shortly after he succeeded his cousin Ahmad Bey on the 30th of May, 1855."
 POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_III_AL_SADIQ: "Muhammad III 'the Righteous' is the Twelfth Bey of Tunisia, he was 'Bey al-Mahalla' from the 10th of June, 1855 to the 23rd of September,  1859. The same day he was heir apparent, he was appointed as Divisional General in the Imperial Ottoman Army. After the death of his brother, Muhammad II ibn al Husayn, Muhammad III took over as Bey as his nephew was too young at the time to rule, although he did end up adopting him. There are rumors about the British consul trying to persuade him to set up the first official printing press..."
