 POR_focus_ban_morgardios_desc: "Originating in Castilian legislation and formalized into Portuguese law with the Filipine Ordinances of 1603, the 'morgadio' is an institution dictating the rules of land property management and inheritance.

The efforts we make to the expand of our vineyards are sure to yield very profitable returns."
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production: "Expand Pork Production"
 POR_focus_expand_pork_production_desc: "There is a silver lining to the vast tracts of currently unused land: the widespread availability of land for animal grazing.
