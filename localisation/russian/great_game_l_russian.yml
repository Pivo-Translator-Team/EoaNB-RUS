This way, as part of The Close Border Policy we must establish and safeguard chain of buffer states between us and them. Russians seem to be quite acceptable for this, but there is still no common ground on where the border should be, on Amu-Daria river or to the south, in Afghani lands. With such approach we will be able to focus more on economic development of India. \n\nHowever, such defensive stance is not the only option in region. Russian control of Central Asia makes their border too close to India anyway, this opens some opportunities to threaten our interests in Persia and China too. We might consider The Forward Policy and try to expand our influence further into Central Asia. We will face fierce Russian resistance and India will require more defence developments, but potential benefits could be vast, especially if Russia will be driven out of Central Asia.\n\nAnyway, decision, which policy we choose, must be taken." #NT!
