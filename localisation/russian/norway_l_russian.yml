It can allow us to have our soldiers spread across the nation and yet ready to mobilize at previously impossible speeds. While they will still need time to travel, merely saving the time on communication makes our ability to prepare for war far faster. The applications of this technology can put our nation above our enemies, and grants us a chance to respond to any threat long before our enemy expects." #NT!
 NOR_focus_traditionalism: "Traditionalism" #NT!
 NOR_focus_traditionalism_desc: "The way forward our training has offered is rooted in centuries of tradition, and represents the culmination of centuries of knowledge. It has brought countless victories to our neighbors, and should offer this same chance to us. In addition, our nation is one that has not had a stance nearly as belligerent as other nearby nations, having rarely engaged in warfare.

 NOR_focus_build_forts: "Fortify Major Cities" #NT!
 NOR_focus_build_forts_desc: "While Norway may not be a nation of cities, the cities that we do have are essential to the very existence of our nation.

 NOR_focus_expand_karljohansvern_desc: "Karljohansvern is the primary base for the Royal Norwegian Navy, but its current state is not fitting for our plans.

 NOR_focus_iron_warships: "Iron Warships" #NT!
 NOR_focus_iron_warships_desc: "Modern naval technology has made wooden warships obsolete as warships. Their only use is against enemies without the technologies to breach their armor.

 NOR_focus_ecucate_cadets_abroad_desc: "The navies of the Baltic sea have become increasingly second rate, and so to gain an education for our officers that will be truly competitive we must send them to the foremost naval powers of this day.

 NOR_focus_new_engines: "New Engines" #NT!
 NOR_focus_new_engines_desc: "One of the most rapidly advancing fields in naval technology is that of propulsion, as more powerful, more efficient engines and methods of propulsion are developed.

 NOR_focus_norwegian_designs: "Norwegian Designs" #NT!
 NOR_focus_norwegian_designs_desc: "While there is great value in many nations' naval designs no one can understand Norwegian needs better than Norwegians.

By developing our own designs we can build a navy that shows the independent power of Norway, rather than our dependence on other nations." #NT!
 NOR_focus_home_engines: "Homemade Engines" #NT!
 NOR_focus_home_engines_desc: "Rather than allow the native talents of Norway to rot away while foreign designers grow rich off our funds, funding the development of native designs for ships will prove its worth in the long term.

 NOR_focus_patrol_coast: "Protect the Norwegian Coast" #NT!
 NOR_focus_patrol_coast_desc: "The first and foremost role of our gunboats and monitors is the guarding of the Norwegian coast.

Individuals are voted for in the largest election to date, with electoral seats being expanded from 111 to 117. A conflict between the more liberal minded Bønder (Farmers) and the more staunchly conservative Embedsmenn (Officials) has been the topic of debate as of recent. With more seats in parliament after the addition of the 57th clause in the Norwegian constitution, farmers now have 2 representatives in parliament for every 1 representative of townsfolk. With this in mind, many of the more rural people in Norway banded together to form proto-political parties, namely the Reformforeningen (Reform Association), a group of liberal opposition politicians against the more conservative population. On the other side are the conservatives, a group of civil servants and government officials who have dominated Norwegian politics since 1814. With every county voting for their own representatives, the question now looms, who has won the majority of the seats? The more liberal-minded Bønder, or the more conservative Embedsmenn?" #NT!

 eoanb_norway.18.d: "Northern Norway remains one of many lesser known and talked about states in Europe. With the last few centuries consisting of controversy and emigration, Northern Norway has only recently begun recovering from the centuries of harsh trade laws. This was in large part thanks to the Napoleonic Wars, and its effects on the region's trade monopolies. As a result, the region became newly economically viable in the eyes of trade, consequently causing a large growth spurt in interest and immigration to the region. The region remains mainly Norwegian by population, however a fishing crisis in the 17th century forced many away from the region, allowing the Sami people and culture to flourish once more. This was quickly followed by a small series of immigrants from Finland and Russians who were interested in trade and land in the region. Today, Northern Norway stands as a quiet but actively growing region of Europe, with new cities popping up once every few decades." #NT!

 eoanb_norway.22.d: "After the short Swedish-Norwegian war of 1814 ended with Norway being forced into the Union between Sweden and Norway the governor-general of Norway was appointed by the King of Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian Constitution stipulated that a governor-general of Swedish or Norwegian nationality could be appointed but during the first 15 years of the union the title were held by Swedes only, which caused resentment among the Norwegians.\nAfter 1829 the post was held by Norwegians until 1856 when it was left vacant until its abolition in 1873.\nDespite being forced into the union with Sweden, Norway kept its own Constitution and parliament. To amend the fact that Norway and Sweden had two different constitutions, with the Norwegian one being more democratic, the Act of Union (Riksakten) was negotiated between Swedish and Norwegian delegations in the spring of 1815. The Act of Union dealt with the king's authority, the relationship between the legislatures, how executive power was to be exercised in the event of the King's death before the Crown prince had attained majority and the relationship between the cabinets. The Act of Union also stated that issues regarding foreign policy was decided by the Swedish cabinet with the Norwegian Prime Minister present.\nThe union was not frictionless however, when King Charles XIV Johan ascended the throne in 1818, he tried to strengthen the executive power which were resisted by the Norwegian parliament. Up until his death in 1844, the King repeatedly demanded to every parliament that his veto power should absolute, like in Sweden, instead of the suspended veto he had in Norway. It was rejected every time.\nThe question of national symbols was another subject that caused friction and wasn't resolved until after the accession of King Oscar I in 1844 when a joint committee were enacted regarding flags and coat of arms. This resulted in parallel flag systems that manifested the equality between the countries.\nRight now, the future looks bright for the union but there is potential trouble ahead. The position of governor-general has been vacant since 1856 and the question is if a new person should be appointed, or should it be abolished all together?\nAbolishment would certainly be popular among the Norwegians which would see that as further proof of Norway been an equal partner to Sweden but how would the more conservative Swedish parliament and cabinet react who sees Norway as an inferior partner and a prize of war?" #NT!

 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union: "Swedish-Norwegian Union" #NT!
 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union_desc: "Kielfreden was concluded on January 14, 1814 between Sweden and Denmark. It was forced by the Swedish heir to the throne Karl Johan, who was commander-in-chief of the Allied Northern Army in the war against Napoleon I. After the battle of Leipzig in 1813, he returned with his army to Denmark. According to the peace treaty in Kiel, the Danish king was to cede Norway to the king of Sweden, while Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania and Rügen to Denmark, as well as paying one million riksdaler to Denmark. According to the first draft of the peace treaty, the whole of Norway would be transferred to Sweden, but in the final treaty, the Norwegian colonies of Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands were excluded, which now instead became Danish. This, that Norway would be part of what they called a forced union with Sweden and also lose their colonies, caused great anger among many in Norway.\nOn May 17, 1814, the Norwegian constitution (based on Montesquieu's doctrine of the division of power) was adopted in Eidsvoll. After that, the elected assembly then elected the Danish Crown Prince Kristian Fredrik (later Kristian VIII of Denmark) as Norwegian king, but without foreign support, the new regime could not in the long run stand up to Karl Johan's demands for the fulfillment of the Kiel Treaty, and after a short military intervention had to give way. At the Convention in Moss on 14 August, a ceasefire was concluded, and King Kristian Fredrik agreed to an abdication so Norway would be allowed to keep its constitution in a personal union with Sweden. He abdicated and left the country on October 10 after handing over government power to the Storting.\nOn November 4, 1814, the Norwegian Storting and the Swedish negotiators agreed on the terms, and a revised Norwegian constitution was adopted and Charles XIII (in Norway Charles II) was elected King of Norway. According to the Union Treaty, Norway would be united with Sweden in a union as its own kingdom with its own laws and ordinances but with a common royal house and a common foreign policy led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm." #NT!

 NOR_idea_storting: "The Norwegian Storting" #NT!
 NOR_idea_storting_desc: "The Storting, an institution founded with the 1814 constitution. As the Norwegian parliament, it represents a free Norway without the influence of the Swedish.\nIt is divided into two chambers: the Lagting, the upper house and court of impeachment, and the Odelsting, the lower house and legislative chamber. After an election, 3/4 of the elected representatives join the Odelsting while 1/4 join the Lagting. Because both chambers are filled with representatives from the same election, there are rarely any ideological difference between the two. Therefore, most bills that are sent to the Lagting are mostly approved without any revisions." #NT!
  
 NOR_idea_samis: "An Oppressed Ethnic Group" #NT!
 NOR_idea_samis_desc: "The Samis are a nomadic people living in northern Europe. The territory they live on spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, with the majority of Samis residing within our borders. Their lifestyle is very different from the western-style Norwegian lifestyle seen in the cities, which puts them at odds with the Norwegian settlers, especially when it comes to natural resources. Even though they are mostly peaceful, the Norwegians have shown little mercy towards their culture and people, whom they deem inferior. The land they live on is filled with metals and other natural resources sitting ready for exploitation, and due to a blossoming of nationalist thought, the Samis have been put through a process of assimilation and segregation, as a part of a program called Norwegianization. Unjust or not, this is certainly not showing any signs of stopping, and the future of Sami culture isn't very bright." #NT!

 #NOR_idea_state_of_workers_desc: "The workers in Norway, like in most countries in the world, work and live in bad conditions. The condition in many of the workplaces are bad, and adding to that, dangerous machines have little to no protection. Workers are also not supplied with safety gear, so a small problem can be quite damaging. If the workers have it too bad, they might radicalize and start to develop dangerous ideas! We should keep them satisfied enough to prevent conflict." #NT!
  
 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten: "Embedsmannstaten" #NT!
 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten_desc: "According to the constitution of 1814, Norway is a democracy with clear seperation of powers and popular sovereignty, although in reality it is much closer to an autocracy. This is because the country is controlled by a powerful ruling class in servitude the Swedish king. The constitution grants the King powers to appoint the Prime Minister of his choice, without any oversight by the parliament or the people. Looking at all of these things together, it is pretty obvious that Norway is a puppet of the Swedish Crown, but only because of the kings influence over Norwegian politics. Although the King is vested with a near absolute amount of power, there exists an organized opposition to Swedish rule. Rural farmers and liberal business owners have been fighting for more self-determination, parliamentary sovereignty over government, and some, even full independence." #NT!
