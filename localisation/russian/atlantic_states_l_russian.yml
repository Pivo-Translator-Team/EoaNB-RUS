While some people know it for its interesting accents and fruits, it's most famous for being home to the former United States' planter class and, by extension, the history of slavery in the region. Regardless of all of these facts, the main thing politicians in Congress want is to retake the South, the home of general George Washington. This particular region has brought a lot of challenges to our military planners due to the wide array of rivers in their east and the Appalachian Mountains in their north. However, they see an opportunity in the Mississippi River, which is not situated in a way to prevent our capturing of it.
