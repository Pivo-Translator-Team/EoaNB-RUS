 GRE_consequences_crimean_war_desc: "The Crimean War has been a total disaster for the government's reputation.

 GRE_rectify_1854_scandal_problems: "Rectify the 1854 Scandal Problems"
 GRE_rectify_1854_scandal_problems_desc: "A great deal of controversy stems in particular from the Epirus Revolt, which we intended to support. The Greek people deserve freedom from oppression, after all. However, Britain and France refused to let us intervene directly, and the uprisings that were tacitly staged subsequently failed. We should save face in any way possible to prevent further discontent."
 GRE_strengthen_queens_defense: "Strengthen the Queen's Defense"
 GRE_strengthen_queens_defense_desc: "In this time of widespread peril in Greece, the safety of our queen is one of our top priorities.

Our queen shall thus receive safer escorts and more security whenever deemed necessary."
 GRE_Succession_Issue: "The Succession Issue"

 GRE_the_garibaldi_scenario: "The Garibaldi Scenario?"
 GRE_the_garibaldi_scenario_desc: "Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi is a freedom fighter at heart, and his achievements in working towards Italian independence have not gone unnoticed.

 GRE_simmering_revolution_desc: "For too long, Greece has suffered at the hands of wicked monarchs that desire welfare for themselves rather than the nation they are supposed to rule. Greeks have endured for two whole painful decades the autocratic tendencies of our current King. We cannot afford to be subjugated once more by an enemy, even this royal despot. We must achieve true freedom and liberty in our nation. To arms, brothers! Zito i dimokratia!"

 GRE_miaoulis_government: "The Miaoulis Government"
 GRE_miaoulis_government_desc: "With the resignation of Dimitrios Voulgaris, a replacement was needed, and swiftly. Luckily, Athanasios Miaoulis has stepped up to take the reins. Son of the famous naval officer Andreas Miaoulis, who fought in the Greek War of Independence, the junior Miaoulis is an apt commander in his own right, and certainly should manage to maintain order within Greece if given ample time and resources..."
 GRE_enlarge_public_works: "Enlarge Public Works"
 GRE_enlarge_public_works_desc: "Our new government has just been established, but it should begin its work immediately. We must earn legitimacy in the eyes of the people - perhaps by endeavoring to expand public works, we can earn more favor from the common folk."
 GRE_reorganize_government: "Reorganize the Government"
 GRE_reorganize_government_desc: "The chaos of the Skiadika already harmed our government, but the sudden resignation of Dimitrios still threatens to plunge our government into a panic, even with a new head of government in place. We must ensure that the opposition remains at least relatively on our side in this time of great peril -- the government will be reorganized to more fairly include politicians from the opposition, to ensure them that their loyalty is valued now more than ever."
 GRE_the_skiadika: "The Skiadika"
 GRE_the_skiadika_desc: "A dramatic confrontation has jsut concluded in Athens. Progressive college students had adopted a new style by popularizing a new hat to be worn on their outings, and the hat-making company was not pleased with this display. Sending representatives to encourage an end to the movement, the dispatched employees instead egged on the students, allowing things to escalate into a fight. The Greek Gendarmerie sided with the employees and arrested three students, but unrest is extremely high at the moment. We must find a way to defuse this powderkeg of a situation before it explodes in our faces."
 GRE_nafplion_revolution: "The Nafplion Revolution"
 GRE_nafplion_revolution_desc: "A revolution has broken out against King Otto's rule! Early in the morning, a large rebel force seized control of the city of Nafplion from within, and began military operations to further compromise our control of Greece. Peace is no longer an option - we must fight these rebels to defend the integrity of the nation itself!"
 GRE_kolokotronis_government: "The Kolokotronis Government"
 GRE_kolokotronis_government_desc: "With the distastrous advent of the Nafplion Revolution, we can no longer allow Miaoulis to remain the face of the Greek government. Having him expelled, King Otto has reorganized the government once again under Gennaios Kolokotronis, a military strongman and fiercely loyal royalist. With this move, the people shall hopefully understand that meaningful change is coming to Greece to quell their growing uncertainty with our nation's future."
 GRE_ottos_expulsion: "Expulsion of Otto"
 GRE_ottos_expulsion_desc: "With chaos in Greece continuing to rapidly snowball out of control, the news has come that King Otto and his family have left the country. With Voulgaris and associates orchestrating a coup and establishing a provisional government, the king chose to leave the country rather than gather remaining pro-royal forces, wishing to avoid civil war. The fate of Greece as of now remains frighteningly uncertain, but a change in course is undeniably here."
 GRE_question_of_referendum: "The Question of a Referendum"
 GRE_question_of_referendum_desc: "Inevitably, the controversial issue of Greece's form of government has been given a proposed solution, one that everyone saw coming: a referendum, supposedly letting the people decide whether Greece should be a monarchy or a republic. The decision must now be made as to whether this referendum is a risk that we can afford to take; will a majority of Greeks side with our interests?"
 GRE_nation_divided: "A Nation Divided"
 GRE_nation_divided_desc: "Greece finds itself politically divided once again, this time between two factions within the budding provisional government: the Mountaineers, and the Lowlanders. The Mountaineers have espoused republican ideals and democratic virtues, while the Lowlanders have used the prominence of their leader Dimitrios Voulgaris to insist on a restoration of the monarchy."
 GRE_consolidate_provisional_gov: "Hold Parliamentary Elections"
 GRE_consolidate_provisional_gov_desc: "With the monarchy expelled from Greece, a provisional government will prove necessary to restore order, and democratic elections are now being held to determine the government's initial composition. This election is unlike many before it, and not just because of the expulsion of Otto; a recent change in electoral law has allowed Greeks outside of Greece to cast their own votes. This may be an important factor in which political blocs find themselves most successful in the election."
 GRE_land_tax_reform: "Fiscal Austerity"
 GRE_land_tax_reform_desc: "Across the political spectrum, the provisional government agrees on one thing: protecting our funds right now is imperative. With a lack of money at the provisional government's disposal, we would not have the means to protect ourselves from the possibility of 'armed dissent.' The people may frown, but they must understand that our austerity is not opinionized; it is a necessity."
 GRE_revolution_cycle: "Cycle of Revolution"
 GRE_revolution_cycle_desc: "Change is coming rapidly, again and again, to the nation of Greece. We cannot remain idle; Greece must embrace the inevitable, and ultimately, Greece will need to pick a side. If this can be said of Greece, the same can be said for its government."
 GRE_side_with_highlanders: "Side with the Mountaineers"
 GRE_side_with_highlanders_desc: "Greek democracy cannot be conceded by any means. In this time of great peril, the Mountaineers preach the importance of our essential freedoms, and we shall make their voices heard for the sake of Greece itself."
 GRE_great_powers_protege: "Great Powers' Protege"
 GRE_great_powers_protege_desc: "In foreign lands, the names of Mountaineer politicians are mentioned with far more respect than our Lowlander opponents. The great powers especially seem to favor our positions over those of the Lowlanders; leveraging this favoritism is the obvious next step."
 GRE_appoint_kanaris: "Appoint Kanaris"
 GRE_appoint_kanaris_desc: "Konstantinos Kanaris is the backbone of the Mountaineer faction, and one of its most important leaders. Having served as prime minister of the country several times before, we would be remiss not to grant him the ministerial position that he deserves."
 GRE_european_before_greek: "Freedom Over Pride"
 GRE_european_before_greek_desc: "Nationalists have been blinded by vague Lowlander promises of a greater, more respected Greece. They unfortunately believe that the Lowlander faction is the 'Greek' faction in this divide. We must remind them that, without democracy, Greece's future cannot be decided by them at all."
 GRE_bring_army_with_grivas: "Sway the Army with Grivas"
 GRE_bring_army_with_grivas_desc: "Dimitrios Grivas is a Greek general with considerable support from elements of the army. He rightfully earned this respect throughout his prolific military career, so with him emerging as one of the top leaders among the Mountaineers, his army ties can now be leveraged to earn the favor of our brave bearers-of-arms."
 GRE_lowlanders_are_the_people: "Lowlanders are the People!"
 GRE_lowlanders_are_the_people_desc: "Dimitrios Voulgaris is a name every Greek knows for a reason. His undeniable experience has given him the skill to meet the needs of Greece's populace, and with him heading the Lowlander faction, it is hard not to admit that 'Lowlanders are the people.'"
 GRE_one_with_the_people: "One with the People"
 GRE_one_with_the_people_desc: "The Mountaineers espouse ideas of pompous liberal reforms, but the hard-working Greek has bigger concerns, like putting food on the table for his family. The Lowlanders understand that the people should come first, not some figment of a nation. Indeed, the people of Greece are the nation!"
 GRE_never_again_1862: "1862: Never Again"
 GRE_never_again_1862_desc: "The horrifying deposition of King Otto was unacceptable. If revolutionaries like the Mountaineers are allowed to run this country, the question of a king isn't even relevant: the disorder that would proceed would cement the dangerous idea that Greek governments can only be shaped by spilling Greek blood."

His appointment now as a minister in the government should signify our inevitable triumph in a conflict between Lowlander order and Mountaineer anarchy."
 GRE_the_fevronariana: "Fevrouariana"
 GRE_the_fevronariana_desc: "Tensions have reached a boiling point with an incident involving the firing of several Mountaineer ministers that has rapidly grown out of control. Lowlander leaders, considering the move a Mountaineer attempt to seize power, responded with armed force, and open battle began between different elements of the military. The situation has 'stabilized' for now with a break in the fighting, but the dozens of lives just lost speak volumes of the reckoning that must come next."

 GRE_agrarian_nation_desc: "Agriculture is the backbone of Greece, virtually all revenue is procured through this sector. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled by any other nation. However, Agriculture here is underdeveloped, to say the least. Even in the immediate vicinity of Athens, it is common to find archaic tools such as rude mattocks and wooden ploughs. Fields are ploughed up or scratched over, and crops are replanted season after season until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Furthermore, Greek olives and grapes suffer from faulty transport under conditions that diminish the quality of the goods. To form a strong base for Greece to grow as a nation it is vital that the government tackles the issues at hand."

 GRE_revolution_continues: "The Revolution Continues"
 GRE_revolution_continues_desc: "By the mid-19th century, the dream of a free and united Greece still burns fiercely within the hearts of the people. The fight extends beyond the Peloponnese — it now reaches to Crete, Epirus, Macedonia, and the Aegean islands, where Greeks rise once again to reclaim their homeland. The spirit of revolution continues, driven by the unyielding desire to unite all Hellenic lands under one flag."
 GRE_acquisition_crete: "The Aquisition of Crete"
 GRE_acquisition_crete_desc: "The island of Crete, a jewel of the Mediterranean, would be a monumental achievement for the Kingdom of Greece, as the island holds immense strategic and cultural importance. Its fertile lands, vital trade routes, and proud history of resistance against foreign rule make it a coveted prize. For many Cretans, union with Greece seems inevitable. The future of Crete hangs in the balance, and its fate could be the key to Greece’s ambitions of expansion."
 GRE_greeks_asia_minor: "The Greeks of Asia Minor"

By the mid-19th century, as the flames of nationalism spread, these Greeks yearn to unite with their brothers across the Aegean. Driven by the same ideals that ignited the 1821 Revolution, they dream of breaking free from Ottoman control and becoming part of a unified Greek nation. The call for union grows louder, pushing the question of Asia Minor to the forefront of Greece's national agenda.:"

Greece’s finest minds must push the boundaries of naval engineering, crafting vessels that can outmaneuver and outgun the Ottoman armada.

More than just a political aspiration, it is a symbol of Greece’s enduring hope to reclaim its ancient glory and unite its people under one nation."

 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy: "Bavarocracy"
 GRE_idea_Bavarocracy_desc: "It has been 14 years since the revolution of 1843 and king Otto still remains highly unpopular among the Greek populace. This great unpopularity is the result of multiple factors. Otto believes that he can rule Greece like his father rules Bavaria, failing to understand that Greece isn't Germany and also not a middle European state. He keeps clinging on his absolute powers not knowing that the more he persists the more unpopular he becomes. The last Bavarian troops and officials have left Greece only some years ago as the king thought prudent to be appointing Bavarians to important governmental and army positions leaving at the same time the indigenous people of the land that they alone fought not so long ago for their very right to be able to define their own fates. In turn, the Bavarian state officials ruled Greece on their own way, importing and imposing their own Germanic models of government, law and education without regards to local customs and traditions whatsoever. The result was a legal educational and army system modeled after the German and French ones. All of these misplacements, combined with the fact that the Greek king remains a devout catholic which is a grave insult to his pious eastern orthodox subjects have caused great ferment among the local populace."

 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea: "Megali Idea"
 GRE_idea_Megali_Idea_desc: "Since its independence The Kingdom of Greece agonized itself with the progress of the Greek people leaving outside its boundaries. It amplified the idea that the current state was just an imperfect construction, foundation for something bigger. The Megali Idea that was degraded by this very concept, created hopes for a completion of  the national vision on condition that the existing borders were greatly enlarged. This very ideology had major implications in the political and economical aspects of the state especially in times of trouble like in the example of Crete and Macedonia later. The Megali Idea creates a strong sense of unity to the Greek people helping them push aside their political differences for the good of the nation and state. However, the king and the at the time Greek governments must understand that in order to fulfill The Megali Idea Greece must first focus on creating a strong economy and a better organized trained and equipped army. Only then will Greece be able to free the unredeemed Greeks leaving outside of her domain."

 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution: "The 1844 Constitution"
 GRE_idea_1844_Constitution_desc: "The 1844 Greek constitution was the result of the 3 September 1843 revolution which forced King Otto to concede to the demands of the rebels for the creation of a constitution. It was modeled after the French constitution of 1830 and the Belgian constitution of 1831. It came from the workings of the Third of September of National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens and it was essentially a contract between the monarch and the nation. Its most important articles, were the establishment of the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the state and defined his rights. The king had the right to exercise legislative power and also the right to ratify laws. It also defined the creation of 2 legislative bodies, a parliament that could have no less than 80 members which were voted by the people on elections and a Senate with 27 members which were appointed directly by the king. So legislative power was to be exercised jointly by the king, the parliament and the senate. The king had the right to appoint and remove the government's ministers who exercised executive power in the name of the king. One of the greatest innovations of the constitution was the voting of the electoral law of 18 March of 1844 which made Greece the first European country to provide male universal suffrage. On the other hand there were 2 main weaknesses. Firstly the fact that the judicial power was not proclaimed independent but it was decided that the judges were to be appointed and dismissed by the king and were exercising their powers in the name of the king. The second and perhaps bigger flaw was the fact that the right to assemble and associate wasn't ratified by the constitution which was creating problems with the establishment of political parties. Although Otto accepted the establishment of the constitution, he showed from the very beginning that he would use every chance he would get to break it by trying to gather as much power as possible in his own hands which in turn caused even greater discontent to his person and made him highly unpopular."
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution: "Memories of the Greek Revolution"
 GRE_idea_Memory_Revolution_desc: "36 years ago, the Greek people took up arms and expelled the Ottomans out of the Peloponnese and central Greece, effectively ending 400 years of Ottoman rule. And so out of the Greek revolution of 1821 the Kingdom Of Greece was born. At last the Greeks had a place where they could call home, being able to define their own fate and carve a future of their own. Greece was the first Balkan country to ever win its independence from the Ottoman Empire and the Greek people take great pride in that event."
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors: "The Guarantors of the Greek Independence"
 GRE_idea_Greek_Guarantors_desc: "Although the Greeks fought very hard and bravely for their independence during the Greek war of independence, it ultimately seemed that they might lose the war. But the 3 competing Great Powers, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France and The Russian Empire having each of them strategic reasons to support Greek independence demanded the immediate end of hostilities between the Ottoman forces and the Greeks. When the Sublime Porte refused to consent to the creation of a Greek State whether autonomous or independent, the united naval fleets of the aforementioned Great Powers stroke a decisive victory against the Turkoageptian fleet in the naval battle of Navarino. And so in the third London Protocol on the 3rd of February 1830, the plenipotentiaries of the Great Powers declared Greece an independent sovereign state under their joint protection."

 GRE_idea_occupation_athens: "The Anglo-French Occupation of Athens"
 GRE_idea_occupation_athens_desc: "In 1854 we tried to declare war on the Ottomans in order to exploit the raging war between Russia and the Ottomans to liberate our territories, but the British and French, the allies of the Ottomans, sent troops and occupied Athens and Piraeus for three years in order to stop us. This event caused a national embarrassment to our King and to our army."
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians: "A new Generation of Politicians"
 GRE_idea_New_Generation_Politicians_desc: "Since 1825 and while the Greek war of independence was raging the first political parties of Greece started making their appearance. They were the English, French and Russian parties. They were named after the 3 Great Powers that helped Greece to achieve and guaranteed her independence. Their name insinuated that each of them had certain interests in Greece that they were trying to achieve. Different politicians in Greece along with the local populace naively believed that each of these Great Powers would help them develop and expand Greece both economically and militarily. After Greece achieved independence and as the years passed, the 3 Greek parties started gradually seeing their power decaying, as a new generation of politicians with completely different casts of minds and background started appearing. For this next generation, the revolution belonged to history. They experienced rapid changes because of the so often political changes and the economic and technical development of the times. They believed that constitutionalism couldn't really progress because the king and his court were undermining it and that the old Greek parties were corrupt decadent, with obsolete ideas. The Greek populace had already lost its trust to the old parties, when during the Crimean War a combined Anglo-French fleet blockaded the Greek ports because Greece thought that by entering the war on the side of The Russian Empire they would be able to annex Epirus and Thessaly from the Ottomans. The Greeks realized that in order to expand their borders they must learn to manage on their own."

 GRE_Disorganised_Army: "A Disorganised Army"
 GRE_Disorganised_Army_desc: "Despite fighting ferociously and valiantly in the Greek War of independence, the Greek army was not a modern professional force. It consisted of independent local chieftains that each of them commanded small groups of soldiers. These soldiers weren't professional soldiers, but irregulars called Kleftes or in the best case, Armatoloi which were policemen formerly in the service of the Ottoman Empire that were among the rebels that fought for Greek independence during the 1821 rebellion. The chieftains also hadn't established a clear chain of command between them as all of them wanted to be equals. After the assassination of Kapodistria's in 1831, the army simply ceased to exist and so when King Otto first came to Greece, he brought with him a 4000-strong Bavarian contingent. The royal government re-established the regular army and dissolved the irregular forces as they couldn't be controlled or fit in a modern army. But that particular move was seen as something very unfair by the local populace as these same irregulars were the people that fought during the Greek war of independence. Gradually Greeks started being admitted into the army and during those years the army was reformed many times. But in 1857, it still lacks many important things that the modern armies of the great powers have and is in no way ready for a confrontation with the Ottoman Empire. The kingdom of Greece must first establish and develop a strong economy so it can fund, equip and modernize the army and be ready to pursue the realization of the Megali Idea."
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade: "The Greek Sea Trade"
 GRE_idea_Sea_Trade_desc: "During the 18th century a great increase in shipping and commercial activity was observed in many seafront regions of Greece. This activity was greatly expanded through a series of favorable events, such as the treaty of Kioutskouk Kainartzi that encouraged many Greek citizens of the Ottoman Empire to become involved in the sea trading business and as a result many became rich. When the Greek war of Independence started, the Greek merchant fleet was easily converted to a battle fleet that helped the revolution succeed but at a great cost, as many ships were ultimately destroyed. Nevertheless and despite these losses, in the years following the end of the revolution, the Greek sea trade was on the rise. In 1840, all the ships of the Greek merchant fleet together had a capacity of 100k tones and the following decade it was further increased. There are of course also fluctuations since the Greek riggers are currently being replaced by new merchant steamships but this will only help Greece in the long run."

 greece.1.t: "The Disappointing Reign of King Otto"
 greece.1.d: "Since the establishment of monarchy in Greece in 1832 under the Convention of London, the Kingdom Of Greece has been ruled by King Otto the second son of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Initially having high hopes for him the Greek populace welcomed the young monarch with open arms hoping that with his wise actions he would guide them to build a strong prosperous and enlarged Greek kingdom. All their hopes were proven fruitless. The young king proved to extremely inexperienced, despotic and an egoist by ruling as an absolute monarch and refusing repeatedly to concede to the creation of a constitution out of fear of losing his power and failing to understand and adopt the customs and practices of the Greek people till the local populace decided that enough was enough. An armed revolution in 3 September 1843 forced Otto to accept the creation of a Greek constitution. Now, 25 years later the situation hasn't improved almost at all. Although Greece now has a constitution and elections are held Otto is still causing instability by appointing weak governments so that he retains his autocratic power and on top of that he remains childless despite the repeated attempts the queen and him made to produce a male heir. And on top of all that Otto managed to repeatedly displease the 3 Great Powers by constantly trying to earn the favor of one of them and by constantly defying their orders especially when it comes to Greek foreign policy. If the situation doesn't improve soon the Greek populace might soon rebel once more and this time Otto might be unable to keep his crown."

 greece.2.a: "Lets hope this does not lead to another revolution."
  
 greece.3.t: "King of Greece Deposed!"
 greece.3.d: "After ruling the country for 30 years, King Otto I of Greece has been ousted from the country following a revolution that overthrew him. His embarrassment during the Crimean War, German heritage, refusal to convert to orthodoxy, failure to produce a heir, and unpopular policies have proven enough for the Greek people. The great powers observe the situation closely, as now with the need of a new monarch they can greater influence the destabilized Greek state."

 greece.4.t: "The Referendum of 1862"
 greece.4.d: "The time has come to conduct the referendum to chose whether we will crown a King or install a Republic. The most popular choice so far for King seems to be Alfred von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and the heir to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. He is a young man and very popular to most Greeks, who believe that if the British are friendly to us, the liberation of our territories will be achieved easily. On the other hand, a significant portion of our population wants to see the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishment of a Republic. If we remain a monarchy, we will enjoy the support of the Great Powers, but with the limitations that come with it, if we become a Republic, we will be initially isolated, but a bright future opens up."
 greece.4.a: "Conduct the Referendum"
 GRE_tt_conduct_referenduma: "Conduct the referendum to chose between a §YMonarchy§! or a §YRepublic§!"
 greece.4.b: "Do not conduct the Referendum"
 GRE_tt_not_conduct_referenduma: "Not conducting the referendum might spark a §RRepublican Coup§!"
  
 greece.5.t: "The End of the Referendum"
 greece.5.d: "The Referendum has been ended and the votes have been counted. After several months of intense campaigning the referendum has ended and the votes have been counted. Unsurprisingly there have been electoral irregularities, and even interference from foreign powers, but now all that matters is the result. Whoever wins will be tasked with rebuilding a divided nation."
 greece.5.a: "The Election of Alfred von Saxe-Coburg and Gotha"
 greece.5.b: "The Republicans prevail"
  
 greece.6.t: "Alfred elected King in Greece"
 greece.6.d: "Prince Albert von Saxe-Coburg Gotha, the son of Queen Victoria has been reportedly elected King of Greece in a referendum conducted amongst the Greek populace following the abdication of the former King, the Bavarian Otto von Wittelsbach, who was deeply unpopular due to his absolutist practices which ravaged the economy of the nation. Should Prince Albert be allowed to become King of Greece, this would reinforce our standing with the Greeks, but at the same time this will cause great dissatisfaction amongst the other guaranteeing powers of Greece -France and Russia- and will disrupt the fragile balance of powers."
 greece.6.a: "Allow Alfred to become King"
 greece.6.b: "Do not allow Alfred to become King"
  
 greece.7.t: "The coronation of King Alfred I"
 greece.7.d: "King Alfred I has been crowned King of the Greeks in a private ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Avoiding the pomp of his predecessor, the whole affair of Alfred's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Albert has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and unproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."
 greece.7.a: "Long live the new King"
  
 greece.8.t: "Alfred not allowed to become King"
 greece.8.d: "Queen Victoria has rejected the Greek demands that Prince Alfred becomes King of Greece. Her rejection comes from the concerns voiced from France and Russia that the United Kingdom would gain too much power in Greece, and now we have to find a new King. A suitable candidate would be Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, the son of the Crown Prince Christian of Denmark and who belongs to a minor dynasty with no major claims or pretentions, and thus an ideal candidate approved by the Great Powers. Prince Vilhelm may not have as close relations to the British as Alfred, but he is a worthy substitute and his family has connections with nearly every European house."
 greece.8.a: "What about Prince Vilhelm of Denmark"
 greece.8.b: "Leopold seems like the best choice"
  
 greece.9.t: "The coronation of King George I"
 greece.9.d: "Prins Vilhelm von Glucksburg, who has recently come from Denmark, was today crowned King of the Greeks, under the regnal name of George which is much easier to pronounce, in a private ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Avoiding the pomp of his precedecessor, the whole affair of George's coronation happened quickly and quite humbly. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Archbishop, most prominent politicians and representatives from the business community. With his coronation, King Geirge has to deal with several issues, including stabilizing Greek politics and dealing with the years of mismanagement that have left the Greek economy weak and underproductive. Nevertheless with his extensive influence with the United Kingdom and Germany he is expected to campaign in favour of reclaiming our territories."
 greece.9.a: "Long live the new King"
  
 greece.10.t: "The coronation of King Leopold I"
 greece.10.d: "Prince Luitpold von Wittelsbach, the younger brother of the late King Otto was today crowned King of Greece in a lavish ceremony in the Cathedral of Athens. Trying to prove to his new subjects that he is fit to rule, the coronation was very expensive and impressed many attendants of the competence of the new King. Nevertheless, the majority of the population views the new King with skepticism as he is overshadowed by his predecessors unpopularity and the fact that his conversion to Orthodox Christianity a few days prior to the coronation was viewed very oddly. King Leopold will have to prove the entirety of his new Kingdom that he is a good sovereign and that he will recover the Hellenic lands. In doing so he will have the advantage of close relations with Germany and Austria, as well as with Russia, though that will upset France and the United Kingdom."
 greece.10.a: "Long live the new King"
  
 greece.11.t: "Republican coup d'Etat"
 greece.11.d: ""
 greece.11.a: "Down with the Monarchy"
  
 greece.12.t: "Revolutions all over Greece"
 greece.12.d: "After several months of severe political turbulence, and while the King and Queen are touring the province seeking support from the people, anti-Othonian revolutions have broken out all over Greece, and they seem to have the support of the majority of the Greek population. The revolutions began with the repressed Nauplian Revolution, but now bigger ones have broken out in Aetolia-Acarnania, where General Theodoros Grivas has declared a full scale rebellion, as well as in parts of the Peloponnese and the Aegean Islands. The situation is critical for Otto as he no longer has control over anything, and even the Great Powers seem to support the people's demand."

Prime Minister Miaoulis is expected to perform, though we might need to 'help' the absolutist faction against the constitutionalists."
 greece.17.a: "Begin the Elections"
  
 greece.18.t: "Election Fraud?"
 greece.18.d: "With the new elections being conducted, we can opt to support the royal faction through election fraud. This would consist of pressuring people to vote for us in the electoral centers and of inflating the numbers in our favour."
 greece.18.a: "Just a few more votes in favour..."
 greece.18.b: "No. We should not intervene"
  
 greece.19.t: "The End of the 1859 Elections"
 greece.19.d: "The Elections of 1859 have ended after several months of intense campaigning by both sides, and widespread accusations of electoral irregularity. The votes have been counted and the new government is soon expected to be called to the Royal Palace to be appointed by the King."

 greece.21.d: "Since Crete was a young success story, the nation did not have time to build a large economy or a detailed constitution that would make it complicated to unite with us. However, this is not the case with the army. The success of the Cretan troops raised the question of what should be done with them. We were given two options:\n\n 1. Integrate them into our regular army \n\n 2. Keep them in the same cretian divisions as they're currently"
 greece.21.a: "A unified nation also means unified army"
 greece.21.b: "They're elite decisions, keep them like they are"
  
 greece.22.t: "Greece requests for Garibaldi"
 greece.22.d: "Having finished the Risorgimento, many Balkan nations have watched closely at how we unified our people, one of them being Greece. They request that Garibaldi be admitted into the Greek army as a general to help them with their own Risorgimento: the “Megali Idea”. The Greek ambassador already recognized us as Italy, and cites shared history between our two nations dating back to the Romans."
 greece.22.a: "Their Megali Idea is our Risorgimento; we should help them."
 greece.22.b: "No! Why should we give our best general to some random country, when we still have wars to fight?"
  
 greece.23.t: "Italy Accepts"
 greece.23.d: "Garibaldi, famed for his work in bringing about a united Italy through the thousand man expedition, attacks on the Papal States, and service during the Risorgimento, has now been allowed to serve in our armed forces as a general, bringing much needed military experience to our army."
 greece.23.a: "Welcome, Garibaldi!"
  
 greece.24.t: "Italy refuses"
 greece.24.d: "Whilst they gave some diplomatic comments in support of the Megali Idea, Italy has refused to hand over Garibaldi, saying how he’s too important for the nation to give up just yet given the “incomplete borders of Italy”."
 greece.24.a: "It was to be expected"
  
 greece.25.t: "Prime Minister Voulgaris Resigns"
 greece.25.d: "Today Prime Minister Dimitrios Voulgaris resigned following a fight he had with King Otto. Voulgaris is known to be an intelligent and capable administrator, but also very hot headed and controlling. With his resignation we have but to appoint a new Prime Minister, who will be more loyal to the King than to his own interests. Athanasios Miaoulis, the son of the great naval officer during the revolution Andreas Miaoulis, is considered an ideal candidate, loyal to the Monarchy and popular to the people."
 greece.25.a: "Miaoulis shall be the new Prime Minister"
  
 greece.26.t: "Newspaper Slams the Monarchy"
 greece.26.d: "A well known newspaper has today published an article where it condemns King Otto and the Monarchy 'for being responsible for the poor economic and political state of the nation' and advocates 'establishing a republic worthy of our ancestors'. These slanders should not go unpunished, or else it would weaken our side."

 GRE_monarchist_support_increase_tt: "§CIncreases§! Support for §YRoyal Faction§!"
  
 greece.27.t: "Public Protests"
 greece.27.d: "Today, thousands of citizens have organized protests in Athens under the auspices of the Republicans against the current administration and the Monarchy. They demand the Prime Minister to resign, and the King to 'become competent'. Naturally such public signs of dissent can only serve to hurt the monarchy and we should intervene before it is too late."
 greece.27.a: "Travel Abroad"
 greece.27.b: "Crack down on the protests"
 greece.27.c: "Let them protest! It won't change anything"
  
 greece.28.t: "Miaoulis Resigns"
 greece.28.d: "Prime Minister Miaoulis has resigned due to the rising dissent of the people against him and King after the Nauplian Revolution. With Miaoulis' resignation we have but one option, and that is to appoint Ioannis 'Gennaios Kolokotronis', the son of the great hero of the revolutionary war, Theodoros Kolokotronis, like Miaoulis he is very popular with the people and he might help revive the popularity of the monarchy, which over the years has become weaker and weaker."
 greece.28.a: "Accept the resignation"

 miaoulis_remove: "Removing §YMiaoulis§! will be §Runpopular§!"
  
 greece.29.t: "The Nauplian Revolution"
 greece.29.d: "Dire news have arrived from the city of Nauplion, in the nomos of Argolis in the Peloponnese, several thousand men have taken the arms and have declared a revolt against King Otto. It seems that the people have grown very much angered with the irresponsible behavior of Otto, and his policies which have resulted in little change in the economic situation of the country since 1833, when Otto first arrived, ironically, in Nauplion. Otto's monarchy began in Nauplion, and it seems it will end from there."
 greece.29.a: "Suppress the revolt immediately"
  
 greece.30.t: "The Skiadika Events"
 greece.30.d: "The day before yesterday several hundred students went to the Field of Mars wearing 'skiadia', a type of straw hat made in Greece. The protest was an idea of Cleon Ragazis, the son of Alexander Ragazis, the Foreign Minister. The goal was to entice the upper classes to buy Greek hats but it went wrong as the hat importers sent their own agents to make fun of the protesters, resulting in violent actions from both sides and the intervention of the police. The next day they organized a new protest, and demanded the resignation of the head of police and a meeting with Otto. Their demands were denied resulting in the arrests of the students, ending the protests."
 greece.30.a: "Liberate the students"
  
 greece.31.t: "Assassination Attempt on Queen Amalia"
 greece.31.d: "On September 18th, 1861, while Queen Amalia was riding on her horse near the grounds of the Royal Palace, a young student named Aristidis Dosios tried to kill Queen Amalia. He was unsuccessful because the Queen turned the horse on him and he did not manage to aim properly. The motive for the attempt was to destabilize the regime since Queen Amalia was the regent of Greece, as King Otto was in a foreign trip. The failure of the attempt managed to revive some popularity of the monarchy, though the revival proved short lived."

 greece.58.d: "On March 29th, 1864 representatives from the United Kingdom, Russia, Prussia and Greece met in London to agree upon ceding the Ionian Islands, currently a protectorate of the British to Greece. Charilaos Trikoupis, the Greek delegate, signed the agreement. The British will depart from the territory on October 2nd and let us take it over, but they will be allowed to retain the use of the Port of Corfu for military purposes. The agreement was largely influenced due to our election of an Anglophile King. The Ionian Islands are the first territory to become Greek, following independence."

  ### GREEK NAVY EVENTS#### 
  
 greece.500.t: "The Question of the Navy"
 greece.500.d: "The Greek government stands at a crossroads, facing a pressing and daunting reality: the state of the navy is abysmal. Decades of underfunding and neglect have left the fleet a shadow of its former glory. While the seas once carried the legacy of ancient Hellenic dominance, now the Ottoman Empire's navy continues to project power across the Aegean, and without a powerful Greek fleet, any ambitions of securing the islands or defending the mainland are little more than pipe dreams.\n \n A fierce debate now rages within the halls of power. Some argue that Greece must pour its limited resources into land defenses and diplomacy, believing the navy to be an unmanageable expense. Others, however, see the navy as the very key to the nation’s survival and resurgence. Without control of the seas, Greece remains trapped — unable to trade freely, protect its coastline, or contest Ottoman dominance.\n \n The Question of the Navy must be answered, and soon. Will Greece embark on an ambitious naval program to restore its presence on the waves, even at great cost? Or will the nation's leaders decide to focus their strength elsewhere, risking the seas to remain a domain of foreign powers? The future of Greece may well rest on this decision. The sea has always been Greece's lifeblood. Now, it could become either its shield — or its grave."

 greece.503.d: "The wooden wheeled steamship Athens, weighing 430 tones and able to carry another 100 tones was made in October of 1837 in the naval port of Poros from admiral G. Tombazi and first named after King Otto. It was used as a transport carrier for the royal family but also as a state's freighter. In 1850, it was confiscated by the english due to the Don Pacifico affair. It was confiscated again with the rest of the Greek fleet from the French, in May 1854 during the Crimean War. Later in 1854, it was assigned to transfer Athens occupants to the islands of Saronikos due to the cholera epidemic in Athens. In 1862, it took part in the Nafplion blockade and in the repression of the Nafplion revolt. Later that year, it was renamed as Athens. It remained in service up to 1864 for transporting military processions in Corfu for the union celebrations of Ionian islands with the rest of Greece."

It was named after King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the father of King Otto of Greece.It was a relatively large ship (length 44.1 m, 1000-ton displacement), was armed with two 22-lb plus four 20-lb long guns, and twenty-four 32-lb carronades, and had a crew of 182. The ship was not operationally utilized, and since 1846 it was used as a training ship (renamed Messolongion after the ousting of Otto in 1862). It officially remained in service with the Royal Hellenic Navy until 1873."

The permit was granted and it is expected that construction will start within the two months. The railway was first proposed in 1835, but the proposal was very ahead of time and was ignored. The issue resurfaced on 1843 under the proposal of Foreign Minister Alexandros Rizas Ragazis, but he was too ignored. It was not until 1855 with the support of Foreign Minister Alexandros Mauvrokordatos that an edict was passed allowing for the construction of the Athens - Piraeus railway, but the political instability would prevent this from happening."

The lake was (and is) surrounded by fertile land, but the lake increasingly encroached on the surrounding land because of inadequate drainage. In response to this, in 1867–1887 Scots and French engineers reclaimed the land for the British Lake Copais Company, by building channels to drain water from the lake to the Cephissus and from there to Lake Yliki (Ylíki Limní, ancient Hylica). In total about 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) were reclaimed. This land was returned to the Greek government in 1952. The Kopais Lake Agency was created in 1957 to supervise the draining of the lake and building of a new road."

Initially a small family operation, the brewery was the first of its kind in Greece, marking the introduction of modern beer brewing to the country. Fix quickly became synonymous with Greek beer, providing a refreshing alternative to the imported beverages of the era. Over time, its quality and popularity grew, helping establish Greece's own brewing tradition. \n \n This modest beginning sparked an industrial revolution in Greece’s beverage industry. As demand surged, Fix became more than just a local product — it transformed into a symbol of Greek modernization and entrepreneurship. "

 greece.606.d: "Since the independence, Greece has been a predominantly agricultural country. The first industries established in the 1860s were also linked to agriculture such as wine, paper, cotton. It has been argued that the discovery of the mines was accidental. A Greek sailing ship is said to have used the slag from Lavrion as ballast. During a stay in Sardinia, Mr Serpieri, the owner of the mines on the island, had the idea of analysing them. After discovering their potential, he joined forces with the Marseille entrepreneur Roux to exploit the Laurion deposit. The reopening of the Lorient mines in the 1860s and 1870s coincided with the creation of other mining, metallurgical and chemical enterprises that took the country in a new economic direction. Social life in Lavrio, having been so depended from the industries of the area, naturally followed their course."
 greece.606.a: "Let's hope this helps us with the crisis."
  
 greece.607.t: "Lavreotika Affair"
 greece.607.d: "In 1864, Serpieri founded the Italian-French company Hilarion Roux & Cie in the port of Ergastiriacchia, Port of Laurio. The company undertook the exploitation of ancient mines and the mining of silver-bearing lead ores. In 1865 it opened a fully equipped plant with 18 furnaces, small ore washing facilities and a railway system. The company continued to expand rapidly. By 1867, it employed 1,200 workers, a record number compared to contemporary employment figures for the entire country. In the spring of 1871, the Franco-Italian Company began to make profits, especially when it began to mine in situ and slag. In the spring of 1871, however, France found itself in a delicate diplomatic situation after its defeat by Prussia. Greece tried to take advantage of this to improve its economic situation."

His successor, Dimitrios Voulgaris, pleaded with France and Italy for patience and forbearance until parliamentary elections could be organised in 1872 and the new session opened. Europe offered its good offices. German scholars failed to provide convincing expert opinions. New samples were sent to Great Britain. The matter began to get lost in the maze of diplomatic relations. Whoever decided in favour of France would, according to Bismarck, be guilty of breaking the isolation imposed. Whoever decided to choose Greece would look like the country's protector, at the risk of upsetting the other candidates for that title. The mine occupation continues. Visiting French and Italian diplomats were insulted and shoved around. France threatened to send its navy and even troops. The new French ambassador, Jules Ferry, passed through Rome. In Piraeus he was more than warmly received. Shortly before his arrival, the Greek government offers to buy the mines from the Roux-Serpieri company."

 greece.612.d: " In the rolling hills near Patras, something remarkable has taken root: a small winery founded by Gustav Clauss, a Bavarian who, captivated by the fertile vineyards of the region, established the Achaia Clauss winery in [GetYear]. Though modest in scale, the company’s impact on Greece’s winemaking has been nothing short of revolutionary. Clauss’ wines, particularly the now-renowned Mavrodaphne, have begun to reach foreign markets, bringing the taste of Greek craftsmanship to European palates.\n \n The winery’s growth signals a new era of agricultural modernization in Greece. No longer confined to subsistence farming, small ventures like Achaia Clauss are proving that Greece can compete in the international marketplace with products of exceptional quality. As the 19th century progresses, the question of how to best support such enterprises arises: Can Greece leverage the growing reputation of Achaia Clauss to build a robust wine industry? Will the state see the value in nurturing small, innovative businesses to ensure Greece's agricultural future, or leave them to face the pressures of foreign competition alone?"

 greece.613.d: " The Allatini Company, a modest flour mill established in Thessaloniki, may not be an industrial giant, but it holds a key role in Greece's growing economy. Founded by a family of skilled artisans, the company has earned a reputation for producing high-quality flour that supports both local and regional needs. In a time when Greece is striving to modernize and strengthen its agricultural base, the Allatini mill represents the country’s potential for self-sufficiency, even on a small scale.\n \n Despite its size, the company has become a symbol of innovation and efficiency in Greek industry, proving that even small enterprises can contribute to national growth. The question now is how Greece can harness the potential of such businesses. Should the state encourage the expansion of the Allatini model, offering support to small factories that play vital roles in local economies? Or will larger industries continue to dominate, leaving small businesses to fend for themselves?"

The potential to connect Greece with the world through modern telecommunications is undeniable. However, the establishment of a dedicated national telecommunications company now stands as a critical decision. \n \n With foreign investors eyeing control and other powers racing to dominate the region, Greece must decide how to manage this strategic resource. The creation of a national company, tasked with developing and overseeing the country’s telegraph lines and future innovations, could provide both security and progress. Yet, the cost of such an undertaking is significant, and opposition from various corners questions whether a state-led push for modernization is worth the price."

Agriculture, the backbone of Greece’s economy, is crumbling under the burden of feudalism and inequality. The people cry out for change, and the government can no longer ignore the growing unrest.\n \n The Land Reform question looms over the nation like a storm. Many demand the redistribution of large estates, giving land to those who work it and allowing Greece’s farmers to cultivate crops freely, without the shackles of serfdom. This, they argue, will rejuvenate the nation’s agricultural productivity and lift thousands out of poverty. The fields of Greece are parched for change.

 greece.619.d: "In the period from 1875 to 1895, the company constructs the core of its installations. Until 1895, the organized unit includes administrative buildings, mechanical processing installations and hydro- mechanical ore beneficiation, furnaces of thermal ore beneficiation and reducing of lead. The ores extracted from the mines are first beneficiated on the spot. The lead, zinc and mixed sulphide ones, undergo mechanical preparation by the dollies and the ore washing units at Kyprianos. Then the ores are metallurgically processed. There are two distinct procedures; the calamine calcination and the roasting and reducing smelting of lead sulphine. The final product contains 95% lead and is extracted as lead containing silver in sows. The company has been, for a long time, responsible for the town's operation. A great number of houses and shops were belonging to them. They constructed urban infrastructures, such as schools, churches, a small hospital and port facilities, in order to facilitate their operations and attract working population. The Hellenic Company is associated with the use, for the first time in Greece, of electricity, the telephone and other technological innovations. Those included the construction of the Attikos railway, thus connecting Lavrion to Athens. The birth of industry in the area of Lavrio, has caused, on the other hand, a degradation of the environment as a result of the intense mining and metallurgical activity. The natural landscape and the lush forest vegetation have been rapidly deteriorated. The swamps and the coasts were covered with solid wastes; the forests were often burnt down by arson, while smog from the furnaces covered the wider area over many kilometers."

Although the majority of Muslim Cretans are ethnically Greek and also speak Greek, the Christian Greeks view them as Turks nowadays, fueled by strong nationalist tendecies in the Greek mainland, which combine the sense of ethnic affiliation to the nation with religious beliefs. Numerous times, the Christians on the island have taken up arms against what they believe are the Ottoman oppressors, but now, after many failed petitions to the Sultan, they look more destined to shed blood in their struggle for freedom than ever before..."

Recent events would suggest that their treatment would be far from humane, and in a final act of rebellion against the Muslim oppressors, the monastery's abbot ordered the Cretan rebels to blow up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender. Following a huge explosion, the monastery went up in flames, and of the almost 1,000 soldiers and civilians within its walls, only a small fraction survived. The incident is likely to cause an international uproar against what the Christian public perceives as Ottoman cruelty against the so-called infidels."

 GREcrete.11.a: "Rejoice!"
 GREcrete.12.t: "The Cretan Revolution Succeeds"
 GREcrete.12.d: "After years of bloody combat, death and devastation on the island, the Ottoman forces on Crete have surrendered and the Ottoman government has had to sent messages to enter peace talks with the rebel leaders. The island will be free from foreign oppression, although it remains uncertain whether Crete will unite with the Greek mainland or whether it will stay an independent state. Given the island's strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean Sea and at the entrance to the Aegean, it will certainly be interesting to see how the great powers react.\n\nHowever, for the Ottoman Empire, not long ago the undisputed hegemon of the region, this surprising defeat seems to indicate that their tumble will continue. The various ethnic groups under Ottoman rule in the Balkans have certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, and it is highly likely that they, too, will take up arms to fight for their right of self determination if necessary."

 GREcrete.13.a: "Order has been restored."
 GREcrete.14.t: "The Cretan Revolution Fails"
 GREcrete.14.d: "The last remaining rebel forces on Crete have surrendered, and the Ottomans have reestablished a firm hold over the island. The Ottoman commanders seem destined to make sure that this was the last uprising of such magnitude there, and the High Porte is said to be actively seeking ways to strengthen their military positions to quell any possible unrest before it can burst. This victory comes at a time of doubt directed towards the strength and stability of the Ottoman Empire, and the world has certainly observed the situation on Crete very carefully, with many foreign ethnic groups under Ottoman rule, especially in the Balkans, seeking for their own path to freedom. For now, their hopes have been shattered. But for how long?"
