  # Events 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.4.t: "Voting Protester in [FROM.GetName]!" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.4.d: "Protester have congregated outside a government building in [FROM.GetName] demanding equal voting opportunities for all people. While the law on the books allow anyone to vote, arbitrary policies, like poll tests and voting fees, discriminate against those who cannot read, cannot afford voting fees, or have a lack of formal education. Often those that are able to vote are turned away at the polls or their voting registration papers are declined.\n\nIndividuals hired from companies have gathered to intimidate the protesters and tensions between the two are high. To make matters more tense, many of the local officials are apathetic towards the working class protesters and any violence done against them will likely be overlooked.\n\nDomestic affairs like this are typically handled by local officials, but we have the opportunity to intervene here if we can afford to pull a few strings." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.4.a: "We cant be bothered with domestic incidents, ignore the issue." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.4.b: "Send in our military to keep the peace." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.4.c: "Keep the peace and push the idea of universal suffrage!" 
  
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.t: "Aftermath of the [FROM.FROM.GetName] Protest!" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.d: "Without local officials to oversee the protest, the counter protesters moved to break up the unarmed suffrage advocates. Only after the protesters where thoroughly beaten, did the local authorities come to break up the fighting. In the end courts ruled there was not enough evidence to convict any individuals that initiated the fighting." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.e: "The protests ended that week without much conflict, as local officials did try to keep peace during the protest. Though the status quo remains unchanged in [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName]." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.f: "The protests ended that week without any conflict, as the military kept peace during the protest. Though the status quo remains unchanged in [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName]." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.g: "The protests ended that week without any conflict, as the military kept peace during the protest. With some government factions supporting the protests in [FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName], the movement is able to better amplify support for universal suffrage." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.a: "Unfortunate to hear, but this isn't our problem." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.b: "At least it ended civilly..." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.5.c: "Wonderful news!" 
  
 eoanb_worker_unrest.23.t: "Assembly Forming in [FROM.GetName]" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.23.desc_1: "By utilizing command power, local authorities where able to discover an assembly that has been organizing in [FROM.GetName]. Brochures have been discovered that outlines topics of worker rights, voting rights for all, increased representation in government and exploitation by companies.\n\nDue to our effective use of command power we have discovered the assembly's existence before it began. If the assembly proceeds, groups that advocate for worker rights will likely become more organized. Contrarily, if actions like shutting down the assembly are taken, these groups will likely abandon political reform altogether. With that said, what shall we do about this situation?" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.23.desc_2: "By utilizing command power, local authorities where able to discover an assembly that has been organizing in [FROM.GetName]. Brochures have been discovered that outlines topics of worker rights, voting rights for all, increased representation in government and exploitation by companies.\n\nDue to our effective use of command power we have discovered the assembly's existence before it began. If the assembly proceeds, groups that advocate for worker rights will likely become more organized. Contrarily, if we sanction this assembly, these groups will believe we are in favor of reform and will less likely take revolutionary actions. With that said, what shall we do about this situation?" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.23.a: "We cant be bothered with domestic incidents, ignore the issue." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.23.b: "Declare the assembly unlawful and send the military to break it up!"

 eoanb_worker_unrest.24.desc_1: "By utilizing command power, local authorities where able to uncover an organization's plan to initiate a political party within [FROM.GetName]. The platform of this local party plans to advocate for expanded rights, worker rights, and fighting worker exploitation.\n\nAllowing this political party to exist will show [FROM.GetName] that our government is willing to do reforms, but their organization will significantly grow through new political actions. Banning party formation will lead towards less reformist actions, but will heavily impede their organization growth. Only one question remains, do we intervene or allow it to exist?" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.24.desc_2: "By utilizing command power, local authorities where able to uncover an organization's plan to initiate a political party within [FROM.GetName]. The platform of this local party plans to advocate for expanded rights, anti-slavery, and fighting worker exploitation.\n\nAllowing this political party to exist will show [FROM.GetName] that our government is willing to do reforms, but their organization will significantly grow through new political actions. We champion open politics so this action is legal by all means. But if we where to endorse this party, their opinion of us would greatly increase." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.24.a: "We cant be bothered with domestic incidents, ignore the issue." 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.24.b: "Arrest the political leaders and ban the party!" 
 eoanb_worker_unrest.24.c: "Sanction the political party, tell them we are willing to reform."
