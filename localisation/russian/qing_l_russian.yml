This led to us capturing the ship, but due to it flying the British flag, we gave the British an excuse to attack us. In order to avoid such a misunderstanding in the future we should adopt a national flag according to Western designs.

Recently the British engaged with our forces around canton in 1856, signalling that another opium war about to come into fruition.
