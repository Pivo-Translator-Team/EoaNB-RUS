 JAP_imperial.1.t: "Deciding our Monetary System" #NT!
 JAP_imperial.1.d: "Under the leadership of the government, merchants introduced the kawase-kaisha, prototypes of western commercial banks. In 1871, Kiyonari Yoshida, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official who has recently returned from a long stint in Europe and the United States, proposed a plan for the establishment of a single issuing bank modeled after the Bank of England. Saying the structure of the current Japanese economy stands similair to that of Britain. In 1871, the government declared that it would adopt the gold standard and introduce the yen as the new unit of account. Hirobumi Ito, a high-ranking official in the MOF, argued that if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes and convert the other half into government bonds. His reasoning was based on the structure of the Japanese economy, which was decentralized at the time and more closely resembled the economy of the United States than the economies of Europe. Yoshida argued that we should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. A sharp debate arose over the two competing plans for the new issuing bank system.' In his argument, Ito argued that 'if we introduce the U.S. system, we will be able to redeem half of the existing currency into banknotes issued by the newly established issuing companies and convert the other half into government bonds.' In doing so, he argued, 'we will recover the credibility of the currency.' Yoshida responded, 'We should introduce the common method of banknote issuance in Europe by establishing an issuing company with specie reserves. By doing so, we will eventually be able to make coins and paper money convertible.'\nWhat shall it be?" #NT!

 JAP_imperial.5.d: "Chapter I: Our History.\n \nFor two thousand years, House Yamato has reigned as the Emperors of Japan and its dominions, creating peace and prosperity under their rule. Our divine rule was given to us by Jinmu-tennō, or Emperor Jimmu, the son of Ugayafukiaezu and Konohana-Sakuya-hime, daughter of the dragon god, Ryjin. He is considered to be a direct descendant of Amaterasu, the noble goddess of the sun. Jimmu's narrative is linked to the stories of the Ōtomo clan, and its purpose of establishing clan ties to the royal line. With the help of local leader Sao Netsuhiko and Jimmu's older brother, Itsuse no Mikoto, they headed eastward via the Seto Inland Sea. According to the Kojiki, Jimmu died at the age of 126, and his posthumous moniker signifies divine power.\n \nChapter II: The Shōguns Dwindling Control.\n \nBut, ever since our rule was thwarted and usurped by the first Tokugawa ruler, Shōgun Ieyasu, the House of Yamato has been kept in silence and withheld all power. For more than 200 years, Japan has been kept in withdrawal from the outside world, but the tides have turned. Edo's shores were dotted with Western gunboats that had appeared on the shores of Edo, demanding the end of our isolation or facing utter consequences. This had broken the already collapsing Tokugawa control, and it was deemed time for a planned and well-ordered restoration, the Restoration of the Emperor Meiji:\n \nChapter III: The Restoration of the Emperor.\n \nThe collapse of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of direct imperial power marked the start of the Meiji Restoration. The shogunate's isolationist strategy was challenged in the nineteenth century by Russia, Britain, and the United States, making Japanese feudal elites aware of Japan's susceptibility to superior Western weaponry. Following Commodore Matthew Perry's visit, Japan was obliged to sign a series of unequal treaties that, like China, granted Western powers unique advantages in Japan. Young samurai from feudal lands that had been traditionally antagonistic to the Tokugawa system rose up against the government in retaliation. They declared the Emperor's return to power in January 1868, and the final Tokugawa soldiers surrendered in May 1869, after much intense battle. The revolutionaries have urged the Emperor to issue the Charter Oath, which promises a break between the feudal class restrictions of the past and a search for knowledge that could transform Japan into a modernized, thriving country, featuring a bolstering economy and a Western army. The restoration ushered in the Meiji period, a time of rapid modernization and Westernization." #NT!

From now on the Judicial system will be its own branch of the government and called the Great Court of Cassation (Daishin-in).\n\n\tIn regards to what form a provisional legislature will take we have two choice. Both feature a bicameral system, where the Assembly of Prefectural Governors will serve as the lower house and the Senate (Genroin) will serve as the upper house. However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. The conservatives among us want only those loyal to the Emperor and his goals to serve him and his people, and the only way to ensure that is have all of them be appointed by the Emperor himself from among the most trusted officials and bureaucrats, rather than leaving it to a risky election determined by a mostly illiterate electorate. The rather bothersome liberals want, of course, said election. How are we to proceed?" #NT!

However the real difference is how the legislators are selected. Due to our mild political reforms allowing for some autonomy in the domains, we can expect each Daimyo to have different ideas how their representatives to this new legislature are selected, and it is expected that many will allow some form of voting, as a concession to the recently disempowered samurai class if nothing else. On the other hand it could be said that allowing the Daimyos to dictate to us how our power should be used is one step too far back to the days of the Shogun and even the Sengoku Jidai!

JAP_industrialization_category_desc: ""As with France, an important consequence of the British Industrial Revolution for China and Japan was military vulnerability. China was humbled by British sea power during the First Opium War, between 1839 and 1842, and the same threat became all too real for the Japanese as U.S. warships, led by Commodore Matthew Perry, pulled into Edo Bay in 1853. The reality that economic backwardness created military backwardness was part of the impetus behind Shimazu Nariakira's plan to overthrow the shogunate and put in motion the changes that eventually led to the Meiji Restoration. The leaders of the Satsuma domain realized that economic growth—perhaps even Japanese survival—could be achieved only by institutional reforms, but the shogun opposed this because his power was tied to the existing set of institutions. To exact reforms, the shogun had to be overthrown, and he was. The Japanese built their own armament industry. As a consequence of these initial differences, each country responded differently to the challenges of the nineteenth century, with Japan diverging dramatically in the face of the critical juncture created by the Industrial Revolution."" #NT!

A glorious fight for a terrible cause—these fallen soldiers lay waste on the ground, slaughtered ruthlessly by our Gatling guns... Bushido no hinkaku, samurai no saigo no toride (Bushido dignified; the last stand of the Samurai)"\n \nAt Shiroyama hill, Daimyō Samurai Saigō Takamori made his final stand, a beautiful fight waged by the surviving 500 samurai soldiers, all of whom still committed fealty to their commander and code Bushido. Despite starting with roughly 20,000 samurai, Saigō had lost the majority of his soldiers and vital supplies in a succession of prior losses, most notably at Kumamoto Castle and Tabaruzaka Fields. Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo, an old friend and fellow revolutionary of Saigō during the Meiji Restoration, was his principal opponent. Yamagata gathered his men, numbering in the tens of thousands, to encircle Shiroyama hill with intricate earthworks, trenches, and barricades, ensuring that no samurai could leave and putting an end to the uprising. The Samurai spent their days in preparation for the Imperial soldiers' onslaught. They spent their time at camp singing songs, writing poetry, and playing games. Yamagata appealed to Saigō for unconditional surrender before their terrible deaths.\n \n"As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough known to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that at last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don't know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saigõ, rather than lengthen the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world. About our national constitution, naturally it is not only Aritomo who knows what you really think. But the matter has been settled over many years of public debate. I, Aritomo, earnestly beg you as your old friend. Writing this my tears fall like rain, and I cannot express myself at all. Please sympathize with the sincerity of my pain."" #NT!

japindustrialrevolution.20.d: "...Saigō, true to the code of Bushido, refused to lay down his katana and surrender. \n \nBefore this rebellion, Saigō would never have thought this would be his way out, as he was a simple teacher of the samurai arts. He was content with the fall of the shôgun and the restoration of the Emperor, fighting many battles for the great cause. The changing winds of Japan and the modernization of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and the undermining of their financial position. His students stirred up tension between the new westernized government and the samurai class, indirectly involving Saigō in these actions. These very rapid and prodigious changes to Japanese culture, language, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the jōi ("expel the barbarians") portion of the sonnō jōi. With all this forced onto the people of old tradition, tensions boiled and the Satsuma rebellion would begin. \n \n"As the new age begins, the way of the warrior comes to an end; as the new age begins, the ways of old must apprehend." \nAfter a search party found Saigō 's body and head, Yamagata Aritomo was alleged to have been left speechless and motionless, murmuring to himself as he looked wearily. \n \n"As Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo was delivered the head of Saigō  Takamori after learning of his death from Seppuku, the Imperial army marched among the fallen, troops presenting signs of peace for the murdered samurai into the afterlife. I could see the calm expression on his face as he looked down at his dead friend. Many of the troops remained silent as they watched with respect and dignity as he ordered the head to be washed while holding it in his arms and reciting a tranquil meditation to the fallen warrior."" #NT!

japindustrialrevolution.21.d: "The Meiji administration formally introduced a new currency in The Currency Act of 1871, or Yen Act of 1871, and chose the term "yen," which means "round item," for our silver dollar currency.

This new currency has come to replace the old Tokugawa Coinage System, which was bloated and heavily underweighted, unlike what the new system will entail." #NT!

Long and tense sessions wear him down on a daily basis, and neither the House of Representatives nor the House of Councillors can agree on anything no matter the situation. \n \n"I sit and stand, walk and then pace, talk and then yell, but all of my efforts are for naught since they merely dispute small and indecisively. Few out of many acts have passed within months, a staggeringly low number compared to earlier years. I don't think I'll be able to calm this zoo, and I don't think I'll be able to get anything through this spring." The exhausted minister moans, his gaze falling on the now setting sun, its fiery orange light glooming over the horizon. \n \n... \n \n“Order! Order! Silence your tongues, and let great Shushō Katsura speak, withhold your insolence!” \n \nThe hall becomes silent as footsteps from other chambers echo effortlessly off the marble walls. Katsura is seated on a multi-tiered semicircular platform in front of a central rostrum that divides the chamber. Banners depicting the Hinomaru, or eastern rising sun, hang from the front of the room's ceilings. \n \n'I propose to this great hall… the basis for the Railway Nationalization Act. . .' \n \n... \n \nThe candlelight glistens on the rough wooden table, which was meticulously carved by only the best for the job. A tiny document sits in the center of the table, and a hand rests near it, grasping a thin, white feather pen dipped in a little cup of black ink solution.

### CHARACTERS #NT!
 JAP_character_emperor_meiji_desc: "Принц Муцухито родился 3 ноября 1852 года в маленьком домике на участке своего деда по материнской линии в северной части Гёсё. В наше время в культуре считается, что рождение является источником загрязнения, поэтому императорский принц родился не во дворце. Вместо этого обычно члены императорской семьи рождаются рядом с домом отца беременной женщины. В случае с титулованным принцем Сати, его мать, Накаяма Ёсико, была дочерью исполняющего обязанности главного советника Накаяма Тадаясу и наложницей императора Комеи.\n \n \nПоскольку образ жизни императора был настолько скрыт за закрытыми дверями, его юная личность оспаривается. Иногда его считают здоровым и сильным, немного задиристым, и он был исключительно талантлив в сумо. Другие описывают его как хрупкого и часто болеющего. Но сейчас, в его возрасте, он возмужал и вырос и считается достойным лидером народа.\n \n \nМолодой принц родился в эпоху больших перемен в Японии. Эти перемены драматически символизировались в июле 1853 года, когда коммодор Мэтью Перри и его "черные корабли" вошли в гавань Эдо. Их дым скопился высоко вверху, закрыв горизонт над столицей. Впервые, по крайней мере, за 250 лет, сёгунат предпринял весьма необычный шаг - проконсультировался с императорским двором в связи с кризисом, вызванным прибытием Перри. Разговоры о "неравных договорах", отказе от тарифных полномочий и права судить иностранцев в собственных судах, распространились по всей стране. После готовности сёгунов принять эти договоры император Комей был настолько возмущен, что пригрозил отречься от престола - хотя даже для этого действия потребовалось бы согласие сёгуна".

JAP_zaibatsu_desc: "The Zaibatsu are a group of Japanese conglomerates and wealthy business families that control sweeping political and economic areas of the Empire, including the big banks. The big four being Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Yasuda, all of whom are titans among the economic companies of our nation. How we will deal with them remains lost in futurity, but they will no doubt play their part in the shaping of the future of Japan." #NT!

JAP_samurai_spirit_western_weapons_desc: "'Wakon yōsai' (Japanese spirit with Western learning) entails adopting Western arts while honoring and developing Japanese traditional spirituality.

JAP_recovering_from_boshin_war_desc: "The aftermath of the Boshin War has shed light on how the state of our standing army can withstand the notion of war: poorly. Our troops continue to be inexperienced in more modern stratagems; military schools lack proper teaching and educators; our logistical planning cannot withstand a drawn-out conflict; and political leaders are concerned about the army's performance. We may stand on the edge of utter destruction, but reforms promise rehabilitation." #NT!

JAP_riots_of_rights_desc: "Riots against our new way of life and the rights of the people within it, dubbed collectively as the "Riots of Rights" by many, have erupted across our many prefectures, posing a significant challenge to the newly formed government; what will calm these meddling citizens?\nThe protests had started targeting symbols and agents of the Meiji reforms that were disrupting their previous way of life: vandalizing and raiding government offices, police stations, newly established public schools, and the homes of government officials and newly emancipated Burakumin. Our government is not a democracy and the Meiji oligarchs have made all decisions without any consultation with our general public, enraging farmers and low-ranking rural samurai, who felt that they had no outlet to air their grievances other than through violent protest." #NT!
