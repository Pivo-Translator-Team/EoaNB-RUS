Prussia, as Germany's leading economic power, insisted on the currency following the traditional silver standard. The treaty will help the economies of all German states' by reducing the amount of exchange administration and cost."

  #Country Leader Descriptions 
 BAD_FREDERICK_I_LEADER_DESC: "First sitting in the Baden Estates Assembly as an appointed parliamentarian and then serving as regent for four years due to his brother's poor mental health, Friedrich I became Grand Duke of Baden in 1856 - though his reign did not officially begin until 1858 upon his brother's death.\n\nFriedrich holds rather liberal leanings, and has the will and ability to enact significant social and political reforms. Being a supporter of a constitutional monarchy and rather reluctant to go to war, perhaps Friedrich I can be a relatively benevolent monarch who improves the lives of his citizens in an age of increasing anti-monarchy sentiment."
 BAD_FRANZ_VON_STENGEL_LEADER_DESC: "Coming from a family of civil servants, Franz von Stengel himself worked in public service as a legal intern, state councillor, and a member of the Baden Estates Assembly. Most recently he has acted as Baden’s pseudo-Prime Minister as the head of the Stengel Cabinet.\n\nA Catholic and a relative conservative in an otherwise liberalizing era for Baden, von Stengel may be able to enact basic, non-ideological reforms and laws with little trouble but will likely find significant opposition to his pro-Catholic Church agenda."
 BAD_ANTON_VON_STABEL_LEADER_DESC: "Born in the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Anton Stabel's childhood was marked by significant political and military turmoil. Stabel embarked on a wildly successful career of civil service as a government lawyer and later judge, rising up the ranks of the legal profession from a relatively young age. While working as a judicial assistant, public prosecutor, university rector (president) and lecturer, as well as High Court vice-chancellor, he became a legal expert who was highly renowned in his field.\n\nStabel accepted a position as President of the Ministry for the Interior and Justice in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, and despite calls for a heavy-handed, reactionary response to the revolutions, he was at the forefront of a successful push for progressive reforms and judicial modernization. After being elected to the short-lived Erfurt Parliament in 1850, Stabel was appointed vice president of the Landstände where he has remained until becoming the head of state of a new, more liberal Baden.\n\nNow, Stabel has the opportunity to completely reform Baden to have one of the most modern legal systems in the world, and to generally turn Baden into one of the most liberal countries in Europe. Hopefully war does not prevent him from finishing what he started..."
