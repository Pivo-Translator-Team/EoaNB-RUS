Montenegrins almost openly support them by sending to Herzegovina almost everything they ask for, from weapons to volunteers. The goals of negotiation have to be the situation in Herzegovina and the so-called Montenegrin question.

Because he held the position of our chancellor, his place is now vacant. We must find someone who could replace him and continue in his job.

We have found someone who would meet all of our requirements. His name is Jan Vaclík, and he's a Czech writer, lawyer, and diplomat with close relation to Balkan and more, specifically Montenegro. He is writing articles and books about Montenegro, its foreign political situation, and many more. By our suggestions, he is the best choice we have."

 MNT_decision_category_clans: "Clans"
 MNT_decision_category_clans_desc: "The territory of Montenegro is not truly unified. It's divided into clans controlled area, which some have hundreds of years long tradition. A clan becomes a member's extended family, and loyalty to one's own clan takes precedence over anything else, including a Montenegrin prince or sultan. Each clan actually creates its almost own independent state. It's led by its own leader or clerics, has its own army, and also conducts limited foreign politics within the western Balkans.
