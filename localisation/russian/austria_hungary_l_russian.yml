 AUS_multi_lan_army_desc: "The biggest problem with the current structure of our army is that it has multiple nationalities trying to cooperate and fight in the name of the Kaiser. There are multiple ways to fix this huge problem like officers' language education, better division organisation etc. But the main point is that through our reforms, we are trying to fight internal misunderstanding."
  
 AUS_HUN_study_our_lost_war: "Study Last Wars"

 AUS_minority_question: "Minority Question" #NT!
 AUS_minority_question_desc: "The Czech representatives are countinuing with the boycott. We can't allow Slavic nationalism and radicalism to grow, as it can have great consequences.

 austria_hungary.601.t: "New Military Districts and Reforms" #NT!
 austria_hungary.601.d: "We have started our military reforms, and a crucial part of it is creating new military districts and reforming the current ones. They should be kept up to date with the current boundaries of the Empire, and we should base them on startegic importance rather than imperial compromises. This way we can ensure that our armed forces will be on the top in case of a military conflict" #NT!
 austria_hungary.601.a: "We shall reorganise the Empire!" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.602.t: "History of Austro-Hungarian Military Maps" #NT!
 austria_hungary.602.d: "Many of the military maps still in use today date back to before the 1848 revolutions, often riddled with outdated borders, inaccurate terrain data, and long-lost infrastructure. As the empire faces the realities of modern warfare, these obsolete maps pose a serious strategic liability. Reform and redrawing are not just desirable, but essential." #NT!
 austria_hungary.602.a: "Interesting!" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.603.t: "Destroying City Fortresses" #NT!
 austria_hungary.603.d: "Across the empire, the walls of once-proud city fortresses are being torn down. These massive stone defenses, built in the age of cannons and sieges, now stand as obsolete relics, hindering urban expansion and offering little value in the face of modern artillery and mass-mobilized armies.\n\nTheir demolition clears the way for broader boulevards, new barracks, rail lines, and the infrastructure of a modern state. Yet, as the dust settles, some mourn the loss of these old guardians of our cities—symbols of a time when war was waged with honor, and not machines." #NT!
 austria_hungary.603.a: "They are reminders of the olden times" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.604.t: "Formation of Ethnic Batalions" #NT!
 austria_hungary.604.d: "With our armed forces consisting of hundreds and hundreds of ethnicities it's getting obvious that this hinders our army's organisation. The high command made the decision to make purely ethnic batallions in order to have better cohesion between the divisions." #NT!
 austria_hungary.604.a: "Is this helpful for the Army?" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.605.t: "Military Slavic" #NT!
 austria_hungary.605.d: "As the empire's armed forces continue to draw recruits from across its diverse Slavic populations, a curious linguistic phenomenon has emerged: Military Slavic. This informal dialect, cobbled together from various South and West Slavic tongues with simplified grammar and vocabulary, is becoming a practical language among soldiers who share no common language.\n\nThough unrefined and unofficial, Military Slavic is proving surprisingly effective in the barracks and on the training fields, helping officers issue orders and fostering basic communication among Slavic troops. It's a reflection of both the Empire's fractured identity and its ability to improvise unity from diversity." #NT!
 austria_hungary.605.a: "Interesting development" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.606.t: "Officer Appointment Question" #NT!
 austria_hungary.606.d: "A growing number of reform-minded generals and ministers are questioning one of the oldest traditions of our armed forces: that officers must come from the nobility. With warfare becoming increasingly technical and merit-based, and with the need for a larger, more professional officer corps, some argue that talented commoners should be granted commissions." #NT!

 austria_hungary.606.b: "Status doesn't matter, merrit does!" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.607.t: "Lessons from the Last War" #NT!
 austria_hungary.607.d: "After our recent defeats we should think about making changes in our hig-command and in our army structure.\n\nThe conservative faction urges caution, preserving the chain of command, aristocratic officer traditions, and time-tested doctrines. To them, the defeat was a matter of discipline and morale, not structure.\n\nReformers, however, rally around the ideas of Crown Prince Rudolf, advocating for modernized training, centralized logistics, and an officer corps selected by merit, not birth. They argue that without such reforms, we will fall further behind the modern powers of Europe." #NT!
 austria_hungary.607.a: "We should stick with the Conservative leadership" #NT!
 austria_hungary.607.b: "We need  Rudolf's reforms" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.608.t: "Status of Artillery" #NT!
 austria_hungary.608.d: "Recent military analyses and war reports have reinforced a simple truth: artillery is no longer just a support weapon, rather it is a defining force on the battlefield. The power of massed cannon fire, mobile field guns, and increasingly accurate bombardments have proven decisive in both offense and defense.\n\nSome in the General Staff argue that we must expand and modernize our artillery forces, invest in domestic production, and integrate heavy guns more thoroughly into our doctrine. Others still cling to the old view—that infantry courage and cavalry maneuvers win wars. The debate will shape the army's priorities for years to come." #NT!
 austria_hungary.608.a: "Artillery is a defining weapon" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.901.t: "Cisleithanien Development" #NT!

It houses the industrial heart of our lands, Bohemia, one of the most advanced parts of the Empire.

 austria_hungary.901.a: "We will prosper!" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.902.t: "Industrialisation in Transleithania" #NT!
 austria_hungary.902.d: "Transleithania has been long lagging behind the economy of Cisleithania. This is due to Imperial policy in the past, and the large focus on agriculture in Hungarian lands. To modernise our economy, we will need to have a sufficient transport system, and higher literacy rates.\n\nThe government plans to call in Industrial masterminds, like Ganz, Eötvös and Baross, who will help us industrialise Hungary!" #NT!
 austria_hungary.902.a: "We need to industrialize!" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.903.t: "The Industrial History of Galicia" #NT!

 austria_hungary.905.a: "His inventions will come in handy" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.906.t: "Breadbasket of the Empire" #NT!
 austria_hungary.906.d: "Cisleithania has long been the breadbasket of the Empire, being the second largest exporter of flour. Our foodindustry keeps the Empire and its population alive, with its centre being in Budapest, the Capital of our great Kingdom. While we are planning to industrialise, we won't forget our past and we will continue to concentrate some of our efforts to improving our agricultural practices." #NT!

 austria_hungary.908.d: "The Chambers of Commerce and Craft has been playing a vital role in modernization of Croatia during the last few decades. It was heavily involved in railway expansion, supporting lines that connected Zagreb to Budapest, Rijeka, and later Trieste.\n\nIt works to abolish outdated guild restrictions, integrating traditional crafts into a more modern, competitive framework. The Chamber also functiones as a forum where merchants and craftsmen could express grievances and lobby for favorable policies." #NT!
 austria_hungary.908.a: "The Croatian Economy will boom" #NT!
  
 austria_hungary.909.t: "Expand Our Education System" #NT!
 austria_hungary.909.d: "While literacy rates are high in our developed regions, but in the periphery of the Empire, most of the population cannot read or write. If we want to thrive for a modern economy, we need a modern education system. We should work towards establishing a new grade and school system, and supporting more universities across the nation." #NT!

 austria_hungary.910.t: "Found New Universities Across The Empire" #NT!
 austria_hungary.910.d: "The imperial government has the building of new, government funded universities across the bigger cities in the periphery. Whese institutions are expected to train not only scholars and jurists but also engineers, physicians, and teachers, strengthening both the state and civil society.\n\n While there are debates over the primary language of the said universities, it should still serve its purpose in increasing the literacy amongst all walks of life." #NT!
