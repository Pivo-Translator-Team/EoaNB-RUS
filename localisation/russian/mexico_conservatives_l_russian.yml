 MEC_victory_against_the_reform_desc: "After years of fighting our long and grueling civil war to ensure that the clergy, the military and our supporters would maintain power, we have been able to stop the radical reforms that have been destabilizing our nation and it's social order. Under the guidance of Miramón, the civil war was a success for the conservative party. Let us celebrate this great achievement." #NT!
 MEC_reorganizing_the_nation: "Reorganizing the Nation" #NT!
 MEC_reorganizing_the_nation_desc: "The nation is still in chaos and division after the civil war ended. Some of our states in the federal republic are still under the process of reintegration, so we should focus our efforts in assisting them, eliminating all liberal resistance and healing the scars of the civil war as we choose the next path for our nation and reorganize it properly." #NT!
 MEC_who_should_rule_us: "Who Shall Rule Us?" #NT!
 MEC_who_should_rule_us_desc: "As our nation enters a new dawn, away from liberal rule, a question poses a threat to our stability. Who shall rule us? Even if Miramón has won us the war against the Reform, his way of governing does not appeal to the elites and the clergy. The parliament should meet without the participation of our president, so we can decide on a new ruler." #NT!
 MEC_los_teocratas: "Los Teocratas" #NT!
 MEC_los_teocratas_desc: "The Theocrats have taken over our nation after the clergy allied itself with powerful minister and they have officially removed Miramón from power, leaving him merely as a general.

 MEC_may_rule: "May Rule.." #NT!
 MEC_may_rule_desc: "The first step to ensure our position in the government of Mexico is to stop the process of elections, as they allow the people to be manipulated and tricked into voting for those who are not in any way, fit to rule our catholic nation." #NT!
 MEC_and_legislate_mexico: "..And Legislate Mexico." #NT!
 MEC_and_legislate_mexico_desc: "The Theocrats need to ensure that only the law of the Holy Bible shall control this land, no unholy constitution should be above it. The so said set of laws are nothing when put in comparison with the law of god. It is time to end it." #NT!
 MEC_the_church_is_the_state: "The Church Is The State" #NT!
 MEC_the_church_is_the_state_desc: "This system of presidentialism will end once the people realize that the Church and the State are now one. But, we need to act on behalf of the people to end it and bring all power to our great Archbishop. No second or third power shall oppose his divine rule over Mexico." #NT!
 MEC_weaken_the_unholy_opposition: "Weaken The Unholy Opposition" #NT!
 MEC_weaken_the_unholy_opposition_desc: "The liberals that have fought the civil war to reform the system and also brought many laws that weakened the church, are the greatest opposition to our government that has divine right over any of their claims and complaints. We should use the power of the church to weaken them and diminish their influence over our nation." #NT!
 MEC_legitimize_our_government: "Legitimize Our Government" #NT!
 MEC_legitimize_our_government_desc: "Our government needs to be considered legitimate by Rome and the Papal States, then the conservative catholics will be forced to comply and accept this new government. We will send a diplomatic envoy to the Pope and with that, our Archbishopric will rise." #NT!
 MEC_Army_of_God: "Army of God" #NT!

 MEC_los_cristeros: "Los Cristeros" #NT!
 MEC_los_cristeros_desc: "The Catholics of our nation have been thinking of creating a volunteer group of fervorous christians who will die in the name of God and join our army to fill the gaps in manpower. They will be the first in line to take the bullets and swords to protect the Archbishop and the church, fighting until the bitter end against the forces of heresy." #NT!
 MEC_learn_from_papal_war_doctrines: "Learn from Papal War Doctrines" #NT!
 MEC_learn_from_papal_war_doctrines_desc: "We can learn new tactics for our army using the brilliant plans from the military academy of Rome. New doctrines of war will be implemented and organized into our christian army, following the core principles of the church and adapting Italian warfare to Mexican warfare. We hope this bolsters our capacity to defend the Archbishopric." #NT!
 MEC_settle_the_debt_issue: "Settle the Debt Issue" #NT!
 MEC_settle_the_debt_issue_desc: "A spectre is haunting Mexico. The spectre of the debt. It's threatening nature might be the doom of our catholic project as a whole, as the European powers threaten to take immediate action against us.

 MEC_long_live_the_new_emperor: "Long Live the New Emperor!" #NT!
 MEC_long_live_the_new_emperor_desc: "A solution has been found.

 MEC_agreements_with_the_liberals: "Agreements with the Liberals" #NT!
 MEC_agreements_with_the_liberals_desc: "We need to settle and re-institute the liberal party. A democratic nation can only be stable with an opposition, however, we need to deradicalize them from Benito Juaréz's extremism, returning the party to the hands of Comonfort, who after the loss in the civil war, is a more moderate choice. We need to reconstruct a friendly relation." #NT!
 MEC_deslaverize_our_nation: "Deslaverize Our Nation" #NT!
 MEC_deslaverize_our_nation_desc: "After the civil war, the reforms that the liberals established to secure the freedom of native and afro-mexican slaves were ignored, allowing for slave owners to exploit loopholes in our constitution.

 MEC_reinstitute_clerical_property: "Re-institute Clerical Property" #NT!
 MEC_reinstitute_clerical_property_desc: "The clergy cannot feel threatened by our government meddling in their affairs, so we need to take their bread but give them wheat.

 MEC_befriending_our_northern_neighbor_desc: "The United States has been a rival since they won against us in the Mexican-American war, but this is not the time for petty disputes. We need to reapproach them and begin to diplomatically approach their government." #NT!
 MEC_send_mexican_volunteers: "Send Mexican Volunteers" #NT!
 MEC_send_mexican_volunteers_desc: "Sending some men to help the Americans in their civil war would be optimal to improve the conditions of our alliance.

 MEC_negotiating_our_debt: "Negotiating Our Debt" #NT!

 MEC_a_free_empire: "A Free Empire" #NT!
 MEC_a_free_empire_desc: "We have decided that we will partially pay the debt that the French established, but allying the European powers in the process by accepting Maximilian as our emperor.

 MEC_weaken_the_moderate_elites: "Weaken The Moderate Elites" #NT!
 MEC_weaken_the_moderate_elites_desc: "The moderate conservatives are highly supported by the less radical elites, who do not want a nationalist state. We should bolster our efforts to combat their influence over Mexico, reducing the popularity of their conservative party and of their ideals." #NT!
 MEC_land_reform: "Land Reform" #NT!
 MEC_land_reform_desc: "A reform on the ownership of land is necessary for Mexico. The moderate elite controls the land and keeps it under the opposition's grip, this does not only weaken our government, but weakens the Mexican farmers. We need to reduce our inequality by forcing a reform by all means possible. The mexican workers shall support the government by supporting it by providing their agricultural products." #NT!

 MEC_root_out_opposition: "Root Out Opposition" #NT!
 MEC_root_out_opposition_desc: "Every kind of opposition within our nation shall be diminished or eliminated.

This cannot be accepted, we shall weaken their grasp over our people by allowing only one-party elections and weakening the church." #NT!
 MEC_strengthen_the_army: "Strengthen The Army" #NT!
 MEC_strengthen_the_army_desc: "The Mexican Army must have all power and privileges to keep their current jobs.

 MEC_send_rebel_volunteers: "Send Rebel Volunteers" #NT!
 MEC_send_rebel_volunteers_desc: "The rebels of the confederacy are not as powerful as the yankees of the North. We may need to send some of our troops to assist them in their cause, allying them with our nation and building an optimal relation for years to come." #NT!
