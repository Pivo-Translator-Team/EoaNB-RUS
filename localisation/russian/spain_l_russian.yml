Although the administrations of La Hispaniola continue to bear a striking resemblance to our Caribbean administrations, they are not completely identical and have undergone slight changes during their years of independence. Furthermore, these administrations are strongly dominated by the local Creole aristocracy, which hinders our influence in the territory. We could respect these institutions and the local upper class without disturbing the status quo too much or we could take advantage of the similarity between administrations to easily remodel the entire structure and ensure the dominance of the Spanish state." #NT!

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.d: "Our recent attempts to return the people of La Hispaniola to the path of the Lord and of Spain have borne fruit. However, the minority most reluctant to change their way of life have turned out to be the Protestant communities. Having these heretics within the borders of Spain as citizens is embarrassing as well as dangerous for the stability of the country. We must decide how to tackle this problem." #NT!

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.1.d: "Recent reports affirm that the high society of Creole landowners of La Hispaniola regularly meets in Masonry Lodges and private parties. Amongst these ostentatious parties loom powerful figures in powerful places within society. Could conspiracies be concocted within these secret meetings? Could their be authentic plots against Spain, as has happened in the past? We must decide how to act in the face of this potential threat.\n\nThough before banning them outright, what ramifications could occur from stripping powerful people from their thrones? Are we willing to make an enemy of such influential people? Only one question remains... what will we do about these Freemasons?" #NT!
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.1.a: "End this secrecy and ban these lodges! Even if it angers them, we cant take chances!" #NT!

That farmer who must bare the torture of the penetrating cries of their wife and children asking for food or clothing.
