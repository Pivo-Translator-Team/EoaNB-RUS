 spain_hispaniola.1.t: "The administration of La Hispaniola"
 spain_hispaniola.1.d: "Following the recent annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain, we have encountered a political dilemma. Although the administrations of La Hispaniola continue to bear a striking resemblance to our Caribbean administrations, they are not completely identical and have undergone slight changes during their years of independence. Furthermore, these administrations are strongly dominated by the local Creole aristocracy, which hinders our influence in the territory. We could respect these institutions and the local upper class without disturbing the status quo too much or we could take advantage of the similarity between administrations to easily remodel the entire structure and ensure the dominance of the Spanish state."
 spain_hispaniola.1.a: "They need the Caribbean administration."

 spain_hispaniola_catholic_morals.1.d: "Despite the fact that the majority of the population is still of Hispanic origin, since its independence La Hispaniola has received different influences from other religions and cultures due to immigration. We must ensure that the population follows a Catholic moral as is customary in Spain, to achieve unity and stability in the territory."
 spain_hispaniola_catholic_morals.1.a: "Raise taxes on those who differ from our way of life."
 spain_hispaniola_catholic_morals.1.b: "Letting them know that they don't fit in here will make them change."

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.t: "The Protestant threat"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.d: "Our recent attempts to return the people of La Hispaniola to the path of the Lord and of Spain have borne fruit. However, the minority most reluctant to change their way of life have turned out to be the Protestant communities. Having these heretics within the borders of Spain as citizens is embarrassing as well as dangerous for the stability of the country. We must decide how to tackle this problem."
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.a: "There is no place for heretics in Spain, expel them!"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.b: "Strengthen conversion efforts with missionaries."
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.1.c: "Let the whole world remind them that this is not God's way."
  
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_protestants.2.t: "Catholic Mob Forming in [FROM.GetName]!"

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.1.d: "Recent reports affirm that the high society of Creole landowners of La Hispaniola regularly meets in Masonry Lodges and private parties. Amongst these ostentatious parties loom powerful figures in powerful places within society. Could conspiracies be concocted within these secret meetings? Could their be authentic plots against Spain, as has happened in the past? We must decide how to act in the face of this potential threat.\n\nThough before banning them outright, what ramifications could occur from stripping powerful people from their thrones? Are we willing to make an enemy of such influential people? Only one question remains... what will we do about these Freemasons?"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.1.a: "End this secrecy and ban these lodges! Even if it angers them, we cant take chances!"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.1.b: "Allow them to operate, but remind them who they pay their respects to."

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.4.d: "Despite bribing the criollo landowners, they have made a deal monopolising the importations of wine in Hispaniola at the expense of Spain's tax system.

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.4.b: "Those backstabbers!"
  
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.5.t: "Masonry Lodge Honor the Bribe!"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.5.d: "The criollo landowners honored the bribe and the rest of the monopoly conspirators have been imprisoned. Though we're uncertain why such a conspiracy was undertaken..."

 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.6.t: "The Crown Strips all Masonry Lodges of Power"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.6.d: "The The Grand Symbolic Lodge holds massive influence over the politics of Santo Domingo. It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections. Often these connections allow them to gain massive amounts of wealth from trade deals, negotiations, and legislation. An elite club one might call it, a club the Spanish Crown is not apart of... and that is why they banned it."
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.6.a: "We will not be put down like an intimidating dog! We will resist!"
 spain_hispaniola_persecute_masonry.6.b: "The Masonry Lodge held too much influence, this is the only way."

It is a high society of wealthy landowners, nobles, and politicians with deep connections.

That farmer who must bare the torture of the penetrating cries of their wife and children asking for food or clothing.
