eastern_crisis.11.d: "The liberation struggle in Bosnia and Herzegovina is causing deep sympathies in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and European countries such as England, Switzerland, Italy, and others, where committees have been established to support the uprising. The movement to help Herzegovina and the Bosniaks also quickly spread to Russia. The main source of support for the insurgents was the money donated to the Slavic Committees in Moscow and St. Petersburg by the Russian population in the most remote areas of the country. The total amount of donations sent to Herzegovina likely amounts to hundreds of thousands of rubles.\n\nThe struggle for freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also supported by numerous volunteers from Italy, as well as the South Slavic countries of Croatia, Dalmatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and, of course, Russia. In the summer of 1875, members of the Russian revolutionary nationalist movement fought among the Herzegovinian partisans. With their help the uprising might be successful." #NT!

eastern_crisis.202.d: "Hilarion Makariopolis, prominent advocate of an autonomous Bulgarian church, passed today away in Constantinople. During his earlier years, he spent most of his time in education, his students including several prominent church figures. He also befriended the figurehead of the Bulgarian National Revival, Georgi Rakovski, partaking actively in Macedonian revolutionary activities. His later years were filled more with controversy and conspiracy, particularly in regards to an Easter service he gave which didn't mention the Patriarch of Constantinople, undermining his authority and in breach of canon law. As a result, the Patriarch sent him into exile to Mount Athos for three years, alongside those that supported him. After the establishment of an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate under Sultan Abdulaziz's firman, he was once again embroiled in controversy after being anathematized by the Patriarchal Synod. This condemnation, later affirmed by the Council of Constantinople, diminished his role within the Bulgarian Orthodoxy, and he lived the rest of his live as Metropolitan of Tarnovo, before eventually passing in Constantinople. His remains are to be buried in St. Stephen's Church." #NT!

eastern_crisis.203.d: "Following the turbulent turmoil in Herzegovina, rumors have spread amongst the general populace that an organized Bulgarian general uprising to take place in Romania. Led by the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), currently headed by Hristo Botev, faith in the success of such an undertaking has been significantly diminishing after a majority of the organization's prominent leadership have been arrested, killed, or forced into hiding in the failed attack of Ottoman convoys in 1873, most prominently previous head Vasil Levski. Despite this there have already been reports from local police forces that small-scale uprisings have taken place leading to the arrests of several people. One thing is for sure, we have to be on the lookout." #NT!

eastern_crisis.204.t: "The Stara Zagora Uprising" #NT!
eastern_crisis.204.d: "In the summer of 1875, the crisis in Turkey deepened as a result of the uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It encouraged the BRCC, which immediately set course for a new uprising. On the initiative of Botev and Stambolov, a general assembly was convened on August 12, 1875, with the participation of representatives from the internal committees. There it was decided to immediately raise a general uprising. A new Central Committee was elected, which includes H. Botev, Dr. H. Chobanov, Iv. Drasov, Ts. Tsenovich and Shopov. After the closing of the assembly, armed action was immediately taken. The country was divided into several operational areas. N. Obretenov, M. Sarafov, P. Volov, St. Drumev, St. Stambolov, Tanyo Stoyanov and Sava Tanasov were chosen as their apostles. A diversionary group, headed by G. Benkovski and St. Zaimov, was also organized to cause disturbances in Constantinople. Botev left for Odessa, where he collected funds for the uprising from the emigration. His task was to bring F. Totyu and Bulgarian officers from the Russian army to head the uprising. As of now only in Stara Zagora there is more serious organizational activity carrying out under the leadership of St. Stambolov. To our knowledge the local revolutionary committee launched a general armed attack on the town, but only a few fighters arrived on the appointed day. We have information that many of the villages did not make contact with the committee. Learning of the armed action, the Stara Zagora nobles immediately reported to us the situation of the revolutionaries. It is time to put the Bulgarian lands completely under our control." #NT!

eastern_crisis.206.d: "According to the data of the Sublime Porte, the Bulgarian revolutionaries from Bucharest and Wallachia are preparing, according to our information, an insurrection of not more than 1,000 men in the hamlet of Chervena Voda. Not only did Metropolitan Gregory betray the Chetta, but he also personally arrested its leader Toma Kardjiev, luring him ostensibly to a Christ-loving talk in the metropolitanate. In spite of this and the measures taken on our part, the uprising broke out days later. We must prevent further actions affecting Ruschuk and Northeastern Bulgaria!" #NT!

eastern_crisis.207.d: "At the end of November 1875, revolutionary activists who had escaped after the failure of the Stara Zagora uprising began to arrive in Gyurgevo - N. Obretenov, St. Stambolov, P. Volov, G. Benkovski, Ilarion Dragostinov and others. They established a new centre of the liberation movement - the Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. It decided to proceed immediately to the preparation and organization of a major uprising in Bulgaria in the spring of 1876. Taking into account the internal and external difficulties in the empire, the activists considered that a massive and prolonged armed struggle would involve the Sublime Porte in a conflict, provoking the intervention of the Great Powers and Russia. This would lead to a consideration of the Bulgarian question and to a favourable outcome of the liberation struggle of the people. The Committee of Giurgiu divided the country into four revolutionary districts, to which it sent apostles to direct the preparation and conduct of the insurrection. According to the plans of the Giurgiu Committee, 24 strong points were to be built in the territory of the country where women, children and the elderly population could find shelter in case of danger. Insurgent units were to take over the guarding of the old mountain passes. In spite of the paucity of information on the revolutionary processes in the Bulgarian lands, it is of great importance to raise the question of future mobilisation and further intervention in the Bulgarian lands." #NT!

eastern_crisis.208.d: "There are several versions concerning the number of representatives who took part in the Oborishte Assembly. According to foreign documents the number of representatives is 300. From this it can be concluded that many revolutionary activists were present at the assembly, who, however, were not regular delegates, but the total number is unlikely to have exceeded 150.

eastern_crisis.210.d: "After the meeting in Oborishte had ended, and following a betrayal by the revolutionaries' cronies, our army took measures for the arrest of the committee representatives. Nevertheless, the feverish preparations made an impression on the local Muslims and the Ottoman authorities. However, we received certain information about the 'undertaking' only after Oborishte from a participant in the assembly - Nenko Terziiski from Baldovo. Gendarmerie detachments were sent from Pazardzhik to Koprivshtitsa and Panagyurishte to arrest the instigators of the peaceful raja. When an attempt was made to capture Todor Kableshkov, the Koprivshtchi activists attacked and chased away the police with weapons. The müdyurin was killed, and revolutionary rule was established in the town. Under the ringing of the church bells and the thunder of the guns, Kableshkov sent the famous 'Bloody Letter' to Panagyurishte. The letter was carried by 19-year-old Georgi Salchev, who made the five-hour journey from Koprivshtitsa to Panagyurishte in just two hours. Just before Panagyurishte, the horse of the bearer of the bloody letter died from exertion. We must avoid further spread of the insurgency." #NT!

But as soon as the surrender was over, the Ottoman troops, commonly called 'Bashibozouks', attacked the unarmed victims and struck them with axes. They eventually placed the bodies in the shape of a tree on the ground and started chopping them down like wood. Weeping, screaming, and begging went forth, and the Bashibozouks instilled fear and terror in the entire village. Women, children, and men fled through the streets to the upper reaches to escape the same fate." #NT!

But as soon as the surrender was over, the Ottoman troops, commonly called 'Bashibozouks', attacked the unarmed victims and struck them with axes. They eventually placed the bodies in the shape of a tree on the ground and started chopping them down like wood. As the sources say, 'Cries, shrieks, and entreaties issued from the lips of all. But, instead of mercy, it excited more fierce vengeance and a sort of bestial triumph in the midst of these human butchers.' This barbarous deed of the Bashibozouks instilled fear and terror in the entire village. Women, children, and men fled through the village to the upper reaches. We also have accounts of the killing of the elder Trendaphil, which was carried out in an extremely barbaric manner. After plucking out his eyes and pulling out his teeth, the Ottoman soldiers impaled him on a stake and roasted him alive in the midst of a circle of women forced by the Bashibozouks to remain spectators until his death. Another man had his legs, hands, nose and ears cut off. First the victims were robbed and tortured to extort their wealth, and then they were slaughtered. Many men saved their lives only by lying down among the slaughtered and pretending to have been killed already. The same day, about three hundred others were killed at the wooden bridge in front of the school, first their arms and legs, ears and noses and shoulders were cut off and then they were finished off. Women as well as children were involved in the bloodshed." #NT!

The proposal also includes the reform of tax systems to alleviate the burden on the Balkan population and ensure proper revenue for the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Russian proposal on the other hand calls for the recognition of Bulgarian autonomy and territorial changes in the Balkans.

With no support from the other European powers, Russia has declared the response unacceptable, and has begun moves to mobilize its units on our border. Elections have already been called by the Sultan, citing that the upcoming and inevitable war with the Russians posed a significant threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our empire. With both the Sultan and parliament in agreement, the government has had little times managing civic affairs in consideration of the upcoming war. Our new constitution and its subsequent parliament have had little time to prove its efficacy in the face of a great diplomatic crisis. With another regional war to occur in the Balkans, the remaining Europeans powers, namely Britain, have taken a keen interest in ensuring that the power dynamic is maintained and kept in balance.

eastern_crisis.501.t: "The Treaty of San Stefano - Our Reaction" #NT!
eastern_crisis.501.d: "The Treaty of San Stefano, signed on March 3, 1878, has caused a great stir among the European Great Powers. Russia, who emerged victorious in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, has imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, including the creation of a Greater Bulgaria. This has alarmed other powers such as Britain and Austria-Hungary, who fear that Russia's expansionism will upset the balance of power in Europe.\n\nIn response to the Treaty of San Stefano, the Great Powers are holding a series of diplomatic meetings to discuss their next steps. The Congress of Berlin, which begins on June 13, 1878, is the most important of these meetings. The Congress is attended by representatives from all of the major powers, including Russia, Britain, Austria-Hungary, and Germany.\n\nThe Great Powers are deeply divided over the Treaty of San Stefano. Russia is determined to see its terms implemented, while Britain and Austria-Hungary are equally determined to prevent this. Germany, under the leadership of Chancellor Bismarck, is trying to mediate between the different parties.\n\nDespite their differences, the Great Powers ultimately agree to revise the Treaty of San Stefano. At the Congress of Berlin, they redraw the map of the Balkans and create a smaller Bulgaria, which is divided into three parts. The Ottoman Empire also gains some territories back. The revised treaty, known as the Treaty of Berlin, is signed on July 13, 1878." #NT!

eastern_crisis.502.d: "The Treaty of San Stefano, signed on March 3, 1878, has caused a great deal of unrest and dissatisfaction among the Balkan nations. The treaty, imposed by Russia following its victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, created a Greater Bulgaria, which included large territories that had previously belonged to other Balkan nations.\n\nBulgaria, which had been liberated from Ottoman rule by Russia, was pleased with the outcome of the treaty. However, the other Balkan nations, including Serbia, Romania, and Montenegro, were outraged by the loss of their territories to Bulgaria. These nations viewed the treaty as a blatant disregard for their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAs a result, the Balkan nations quickly began to mobilize their armies and prepare for a potential conflict. Serbia, in particular, saw the Treaty of San Stefano as a direct threat to its existence and began to plan a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire, which was seen as being in cahoots with Russia.\n\nThe unrest in the Balkans soon caught the attention of the Great Powers, who were concerned about the potential for a larger conflict. They convened the Congress of Berlin on June 13, 1878, in order to revise the Treaty of San Stefano and to find a solution that would be acceptable to all parties.\n\nAt the Congress, the Balkan nations made their objections to the Treaty of San Stefano clear. They argued for the restoration of their territories and for the recognition of their sovereignty. Ultimately, the revised treaty, known as the Treaty of Berlin, was signed on July 13, 1878. The Balkan nations regained some of their territories, but were left with a sense of dissatisfaction and unease.\n\nAs the Balkan nations continue to simmer with resentment over the Treaty of San Stefano, the Great Powers know that they must work to maintain stability in the region and to prevent further conflicts from erupting." #NT!
